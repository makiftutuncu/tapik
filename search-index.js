uses a multi-module Gradle build with Kotlin DSL, configuration cache, and extensive code generation. Follow these practices when contributing. Core libraries: core, codec, jackson Generators: spring-restclient, spring-webmvc, common-plugin Gradle integration: gradle-plugin, shared conventions in the build-logic included build Docs: Antora site in docs/ with playbook at antora-playbook.yml Module directories mirror the base package requirement: files under src/main/kotlin start immediately after dev/akif/tapik (for example, core/src/main/kotlin/HttpEndpoint.kt declares dev.akif.tapik.HttpEndpoint). Task Command Notes Full build & tests ./gradlew build Compiles all modules, runs unit tests Verification suite ./gradlew check Includes ktlint and plugin checks Formatting audit ./gradlew ktlintCheck Use during CI or pre-commit Auto-format ./gradlew ktlintFormat Apply before committing formatting fixes Dokka docs ./gradlew dokkaGenerateHtml Must succeed; fails on undocumented public APIs Generate outputs ./gradlew tapikGenerate Refreshes generated clients, controllers, docs Docs build npm run docs:preview Rebuilds the Antora site Tips: Pass -PskipLint for quick local iteration; CI should run without it. Disable configuration cache while debugging with -Dorg.gradle.configuration-cache=false. Plugin validation runs only when -PrunPluginValidation is set. Kotlin style follows .editorconfig (4-space indent, 120-char lines, LF endings). Avoid wildcard imports unless they simplify tapik package usage. Keep packages under dev.akif.tapik.<module>; respect the flattened directory structure. Document every public API with KDoc, including type parameters, parameters, returns, and throws. Generated sources belong under build/ or generated/; keep them out of VCS unless explicitly required. Use kotlin(\"test\") with JUnit 5 (junit-jupiter-params for parameterized cases). Place unit tests adjacent to the module (src/test/kotlin). For focused runs: ./gradlew :module:test. Integration flows (e.g., Spring-specific) should live in dedicated source sets such as integrationTest. Favour descriptive test names that outline behaviour rather than method names. Update KDoc and run ./gradlew dokkaGenerateHtml before shipping changes. Rebuild the Antora site (npm run docs:preview) locally if you modify AsciiDoc or navigation. Generated documentation must include the footer © {currentYear} Mehmet Akif Tütüncü; the Dokka configuration enforces it - do not strip it. For local previews that include the API reference, run ./gradlew dokkaGenerate then ./docs/scripts/copy-api.sh after the Antora build. Releases use the current version. After a successful GitHub release, CI automatically runs ./gradlew bumpVersion (defaults to a patch bump) and pushes the commit to the target branch so new development starts with a higher version. For local bumps (e.g., pre-release rehearsal), run ./gradlew bumpVersion -PnewVersion=<nextVersion>; omit newVersion to auto-increment the patch. The task rewrites gradle.properties, docs (AsciiDoc/HTML), Gradle scripts, and properties files that mention the previous version while skipping build outputs and .gradle state. The task writes changes to disk; commit them along with any regenerated docs. Docs are published from release tags; they reflect the latest released version, not unreleased changes on main. Published docs are versioned with Antora: each release tag produces a version and the site default tracks the newest tag. Declare dependencies through the version catalog (gradle/libs.versions.toml). Reuse bundles like libs.bundles.testCommon to keep versions aligned. Avoid hard-coded coordinates in build scripts; prefer catalog aliases. Update or add tests that cover the behaviour you changed. Run ./gradlew ktlintFormat build and ensure both pass. Refresh generated outputs (tapikGenerate, Dokka) if your change affects them. Verify Antora builds locally (npm run docs:preview) when touching documentation. Craft concise, imperative commit messages (e.g., Add Spring WebMVC generator). Open a PR with intent, summary, linked issues, and screenshots/logs for user-visible changes. Request review from the relevant CODEOWNERS.

You do not need prior knowledge of tapik-follow the numbered steps and you will generate code and documentation within minutes. tapik is split into JVM artifacts so you can pick only what your service requires: Use Case Dependency Define endpoints, parameters, headers, codecs implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.1\") Use ready-made string/byte codecs implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:codec:0.2.1\") Encode/decode JSON with Jackson implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.1\") Generate Spring RestClient clients implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:spring-restclient:0.2.1\") Generate Spring WebMVC controllers implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:spring-webmvc:0.2.1\") Add them to your build.gradle.kts alongside the Kotlin JVM plugin. tapik integrates with Gradle to scan compiled classes and run generators. Enable the plugin and declare the packages that contain your endpoints: plugins { id(\"dev.akif.tapik.plugin.gradle\") version \"0.2.1\" } dependencies { implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.1\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:codec:0.2.1\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.1\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:spring-restclient:0.2.1\") } tapik { endpointPackages(\"com.acme.catalog\") springRestClient { } markdownDocumentation { } } endpointPackages should include every package that holds val properties returning HttpEndpoint. Declaring springRestClient { } or markdownDocumentation { } is enough to opt into the corresponding generator; future options will live inside those blocks. Create a Kotlin file in src/main/kotlin/com/acme/catalog/ProductEndpoints.kt and describe the HTTP contract using the tapik DSL: package com.acme.catalog import dev.akif.tapik.* import dev.akif.tapik.codec.StringCodecs import dev.akif.tapik.jackson.jsonBody object ProductEndpoints { private val productId = path.uuid(\"productId\") val getProduct by endpoint( description = \"Fetch product details\", details = \"Returns localized information when the optional locale query parameter is supplied.\" ) { get(\"products\" / productId + query.string(\"locale\").optional(\"en-US\")) .input(header.uuid(\"X-Request-Id\")) .output(Status.OK) { jsonBody<ProductView>(\"product\") } .output(Status.NOT_FOUND) { jsonBody<ProblemDetails>(\"problem\") } } } The DSL captures everything tapik needs: Path and query parameters (with codecs and defaults). Request headers, bodies, media types. Response variants keyed by status matchers. Run the tapik task after the Kotlin compiler produces bytecode: ./gradlew tapikGenerate Behind the scenes the plugin: Scans compiled classes under the packages you configured.

New to tapik? Start with Getting Started for a step-by-step tutorial before diving into the full plugin reference below. JDK compatible with the repository defaults (javaTargetVersion=21, toolchain javaToolchainVersion=24 in gradle.properties). Gradle 9+ with the Kotlin DSL; configuration cache and task caching are supported out of the box. Kotlin 2.2.20 (supplied via the Gradle toolchain). Optional modules you plan to use, such as dev.akif.tapik:jackson for JSON bodies or Spring starters for generated code. Component Example Dependency Endpoint DSL implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.1\") Codecs implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:codec:0.2.1\") Jackson integration implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.1\") Gradle plugin id(\"dev.akif.tapik.plugin.gradle\") version \"0.2.1\" The version numbers match the repository snapshot (version=0.2.1). Replace them with the release you are consuming. Configure the plugin in a module that produces HTTP endpoints or needs generated sources: plugins { kotlin(\"jvm\") id(\"dev.akif.tapik.plugin.gradle\") version \"0.2.1\" } dependencies { implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.1\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.1\") // for JSON helpers } tapik { endpointPackages( \"com.acme.catalog.endpoints\", \"com.acme.shared.http\" ) springRestClient { /* enables the Spring RestClient generator */ } springWebMvc { /* enables the Spring WebMVC generator */ } markdownDocumentation { /* enables the Markdown documentation generator */ } } Key things to remember: endpointPackages must reference the packages where compiled endpoint properties live. The scanner filters classes using these prefixes. The nested generator blocks are markers; you do not need to configure anything inside them unless future versions expose options. Generated Kotlin sources land under build/generated/sources/tapik/main/kotlin and are added to the main source set automatically. Non-source artefacts (for example, Markdown files) are written under build/generated. Endpoints are compile-time constants built with the DSL in the core module. The DSL collects metadata from property names, documentation strings, and nested builders. package com.acme.catalog.endpoints import dev.akif.tapik.* import dev.akif.tapik.jackson.jsonBody object ProductEndpoints { private val productId = path.uuid(\"productId\") private val locale = query.string(\"locale\").optional(\"en-US\") val getProduct by endpoint( description = \"Fetch product details\", details = \"Returns localized information when the locale query parameter is supplied.\" ) { get(\"products\" / productId + locale) .input(header.uuid(\"X-Request-Id\")) .output(Status.OK) { jsonBody<ProductView>(\"product\") } .output(Status.NOT_FOUND) { jsonBody<ProblemDetails>(\"problem\") } } } Highlights: endpoint { ... } infers the endpoint id from the property name (getProduct). The description and details flow into generated KDoc and Markdown. Path building uses operator overloads: \"products\" / productId. Query parameters append with , headers with +input { ... }, and outputs use output(Status.OK) { ... }. Response variants can be chained; the DSL supports OneOf unions to model branching behaviour. tapik registers an aggregated tapikGenerate task. It depends on classes for the current project and its siblings to ensure bytecode is available. ./gradlew :service:tapikGenerate Execution flow: Compiled classes are scanned for properties that return HttpEndpoint. Metadata describing the endpoints is persisted to build/generated/tapik-endpoints.txt. The selected generators (spring-restclient, spring-webmvc, markdown-docs) run sequentially. Generated sources are attached to the IDE/classpath; you can ./gradlew build without special configuration. You can run ./gradlew :service:classes tapikGenerate during fast feedback loops. Pass -PskipLint if you want to avoid ktlint locally. Kotlin sources live under build/generated/sources/tapik/main/kotlin. Markdown documentation is emitted to build/generated/API.md. Scan report: build/generated/tapik-endpoints.txt contains the raw metadata list. When checking generated Kotlin into source control: Run ./gradlew tapikGenerate after any endpoint changes. Review generated types as you would review hand-written code; they carry KDoc extracted from your endpoints. For reproducibility, make sure the versions of tapik dependencies are pinned via a version catalog or BOM. Symptom Common Cause Fix Missing compiled classes warning classes task did not run before tapikGenerate Run ./gradlew classes tapikGenerate or wire tasks in your CI pipeline No generators execute Generator blocks omitted in the tapik extension Add springRestClient { }, springWebMvc { }, or markdownDocumentation { } Class not found during scan Endpoint package not covered by endpointPackages Ensure fully qualified package prefixes are listed Unexpected HTTP mappings Endpoint path missing leading segment Start URIs with \"segment\" or \"segment\" / ... If you create custom generators, place their implementation on the build classpath and expose them via the Java ServiceLoader contract.

Example excerpt: interface ProductEndpointsClient : RestClientBasedClient { /** * Fetch product details. */ fun getProduct( productId: UUID, locale: String = \"en-US\", xRequestId: UUID ): Response0<ProductView> { val responseEntity = interpreter.send( method = ProductEndpoints.getProduct.method, uri = ProductEndpoints.getProduct.toURI(productId, locale), inputHeaders = ProductEndpoints.getProduct.input.encodeInputHeaders(xRequestId), inputBodyContentType = ProductEndpoints.getProduct.input.body.mediaType, inputBody = ByteArray(0), outputs = ProductEndpoints.getProduct.outputs.toList() ) val status = responseEntity.statusCode.toStatus() val bodyBytes = responseEntity.body ?: ByteArray(0) val decodedBody = ProductEndpoints.getProduct.outputs.item1.body.codec.decode(bodyBytes) .getOrElse { error(it.joinToString(\": \")) } return Response0(status, decodedBody) } } Names and types are inferred from your endpoint declarations: path/query parameters become function parameters, headers with codecs translate into arguments, and bodies map to encoded values.

Headers are encoded via the Input.encodeInputHeaders helpers from core; responses use the decodeHeadersX utilities to validate and decode header values. Bodies use the codec attached to the Body definition (for example, Jackson-based JSON codecs). Any CodecFailure surfaces as an IllegalStateException in generated code so mismatches fail fast. RestClientInterpreter validates response status codes and media types before the generator attempts to decode bodies, surfacing detailed RestClientResponseException messages when mismatches occur. Create a Spring-managed implementation by delegating to the generated interface: @Component class HttpProductClient( override val restClient: RestClient ) : ProductEndpointsClient RestClientBasedClient provides interpreter automatically, so implementations only supply the RestClient. You may inject a configured RestClient.Builder or reuse the application-wide client. Drive endpoint behaviour through unit tests on the DSL before running code generation. Use Spring’s MockRestServiceServer to verify generated clients: intercept outgoing requests, assert the expected path/headers/body, and feed back fixtures that satisfy your endpoint outputs. If you customise codecs, add integration tests to ensure RestClientInterpreter can successfully decode the wire format. Provide your own RestClient (set timeouts, interceptors, authentication) while reusing generated code. Override functions in the generated interface by writing extension functions or wrapping the generated interface inside a higher-level service. Add new generators for other HTTP client stacks by following the steps in Code Generation Overview; the Spring client serves as a realistic template.","title":"Spring RestClient Clients","component":"tapik","version":"v0.2.1","name":"client","url":"/tapik/v0.2.1/code-generation/client.html","titles":[{"text":"Generated Structure","hash":"_generated_structure","id":1},{"text":"Return Types","hash":"_return_types","id":2},{"text":"Header and Body Handling","hash":"_header_and_body_handling","id":3},{"text":"Instantiating Clients","hash":"_instantiating_clients","id":4},{"text":"Testing Tips","hash":"_testing_tips","id":5},{"text":"Customisation Hooks","hash":"_customisation_hooks","id":6}]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"tapik ships a Markdown generator (markdown-docs) that produces a lightweight API reference from your endpoint definitions.

Implement the generated interfaces to keep routing, validation, and response typing aligned with the DSL. Location: build/generated/sources/tapik/main/kotlin/<package>/<SourceFile>Controller.kt Interface name: <SourceFile>Controller Annotations: Each method is decorated with the appropriate @GetMapping, @PostMapping, …​ annotations derived from the endpoint metadata, including path, consumes, and produces attributes. Parameters: Path variables receive @SpringPathVariable, query parameters use @RequestParam, headers use @RequestHeader, and bodies use @RequestBody. Default values defined in the DSL are carried into the annotation attributes. Return type: Methods return tapik ResponseX or ResponseWithoutBodyX types. When multiple outputs exist, the return type is OneOfK<...> containing those responses. Example excerpt: interface ProductEndpointsController { /** * Fetch product details. */ @GetMapping( path = [\"/products/{productId}\"], produces = [\"application/json\"] ) fun getProduct( @SpringPathVariable(\"productId\") productId: UUID, @RequestParam(name = \"locale\", required = false, defaultValue = \"en-US\") locale: String, @RequestHeader(name = \"X-Request-Id\") xRequestId: UUID ): Response0<ProductView> } Wire an implementation in your Spring application: @Component class ProductHandler : ProductEndpointsController { override fun getProduct( productId: UUID, locale: String, xRequestId: UUID ): Response0<ProductView> { // fetch domain model and map it into the tapik response type val product = service.lookup(productId, locale) return Response0(Status.OK, product) } } The return value captures the HTTP status, headers, and body exactly as you modelled them in the DSL. Use helper builders from dev.akif.tapik (for example, Response0, ResponseWithoutBody1, OneOf2.Option1) to produce the response variant that matches the status you intend to emit. Create a lightweight HTTP adapter that converts the tapik response to a Spring ResponseEntity using the extensions in TapikResponseEntity.kt: @RestController class ProductController( private val handler: ProductHandler ) { @GetMapping(\"/products/{productId}\") fun getProduct( productId: UUID, locale: String, xRequestId: UUID ): ResponseEntity<Any?> = ProductEndpoints.getProduct.toResponseEntity( handler.getProduct(productId, locale, xRequestId) ) } toResponseEntity(Response<*>) handles single-output endpoints. toResponseEntity(OneOf) handles multi-output unions. Status and media-type conversions rely on Status.toHttpStatus() and MediaType.toSpringMediaType() helpers bundled with the generator. toResponseEntity enforces that your implementation returns the declared number of headers and selects the matching output variant for OneOf unions. If a mismatch occurs (for example, returning Option2 while only one output is defined), the helper throws an error pointing at the offending endpoint. Reuse DSL metadata: The generated interface references the HttpEndpoint instances, so you can lean on .outputs or .parameters inside your implementation for additional logic (for example, building links). Combine with Spring validation: Annotate generated parameters with additional validation annotations (e.g., @Valid, @NotBlank) in partial classes or wrapper controllers if you need extra constraints. Return domain models: The response builders accept your domain types. Keep encoding logic inside the DSL via codecs so controller implementations stay small. Unit-test with tapik types: Write tests against the generated interface contracts to verify that every response path returns the appropriate Response* wrapper. Pair with the toResponseEntity helper for end-to-end tests. The generator chooses method-level annotations based on the HTTP verb. For uncommon verbs (such as OPTIONS or TRACE), it emits @RequestMapping(method = [RequestMethod.VERB], path = [...]). If you need additional attributes (for example, security annotations or custom @CrossOrigin settings), declare them in your concrete controller implementation-interfaces are kept lean on purpose.","title":"Spring WebMVC Controllers","component":"tapik","version":"v0.2.1","name":"server","url":"/tapik/v0.2.1/code-generation/server.html","titles":[{"text":"Generated Structure","hash":"_generated_structure","id":1},{"text":"Implementing Controllers","hash":"_implementing_controllers","id":2},{"text":"Rendering Spring Responses","hash":"_rendering_spring_responses","id":3},{"text":"Status and Header Validation","hash":"_status_and_header_validation","id":4},{"text":"Tips for Server Implementations","hash":"_tips_for_server_implementations","id":5},{"text":"Customising Routing","hash":"_customising_routing","id":6}]},"9":{"id":9,"text":"tapik’s primary goal is to keep HTTP contracts type-safe from declaration to runtime. The DSL models every piece of an endpoint-parameters, headers, bodies, and response branches-with immutable, strongly-typed structures. Generators rely on these structures to emit Kotlin that cannot drift from the original definition. Concept Interface Purpose Common Aliases Heterogeneous tuple (product) AllOf Represents all items that must exist together Parameters, Headers, Outputs, HeaderValues, Responses Discriminated union (sum) OneOf Represents one branch chosen at runtime OneOf2, OneOf3, …​ up to OneOf10 AllOf is a family of interfaces (AllOf0 …​ AllOf10) with itemN accessors. Concrete tapik types reuse these through the Tuple facade so you do not manipulate AllOf directly. typealias Headers3<H1, H2, H3> = Tuple3<Header<*>, Header<H1>, Header<H2>, Header<H3>> Because Headers3 implements AllOf4, the compiler knows: headers.item1 is the first Header<*>. headers.item2 is Header<H1>, preserving the codec type. Iteration is still possible via the Listable interface. tapik ships aliases for each arity so you can declare headers, parameters, and responses without manual tuple plumbing: Alias Description Parameters0 …​ Parameters10 Path/query parameter definitions Headers0 …​ Headers10 Request header definitions HeaderValues0 …​ HeaderValues10 Decoded inbound header values Outputs0 …​ Outputs10 Ordered list of (StatusMatcher, Headers, Body) combinations Response0 / ResponseWithoutBody0 families Runtime responses returned by generated code OneOf models exclusive branches. Each arity exposes inline OptionN value classes and a select helper for exhaustive handling. fun interpret(result: OneOf3<Response0<User>, ResponseWithoutBody0, ResponseWithoutBody0>) = result.select( when1 = { response -> \"Found user ${response.body.id}\" }, when2 = { \"User missing\" }, when3 = { \"User deleted\" } ) Generators lean on these unions in two places: Client code returns OneOfK when an endpoint declares multiple outputs, forcing call sites to handle every status path. Server code expects implementers to return the matching OptionN when emitting a non-default response, ensuring real runtime branches align with the DSL. Outputs is an AllOf tuple of Output definitions. At runtime, responses are wrapped in either a concrete ResponseX (single output) or a OneOfK<ResponseX, ...> (multiple outputs). This combination gives tapik strong guarantees: The number and order of outputs in the DSL matches the generated code and Markdown documentation. Header codecs are preserved all the way to runtime decoding (decodeHeadersN). Exhaustive select calls mean adding a new output is a compile-time change for every consumer. flowchart TD DSL[\"HttpEndpoint DSL\"] --> Tuple[\"Tuple / AllOf metadata\"] Tuple --> Outputs[\"Outputs tuple\"] Outputs -->|single| Response[\"ResponseX\"] Outputs -->|multiple| Union[\"OneOfK ResponseX\"] Response --> Client[\"Generated client\"] Union --> Client Response --> Server[\"Generated controller\"] Union --> Server Prefer aliases: use Headers3 instead of wiring Tuple3 manually. The aliases pick correct variance and marker interfaces. Let the DSL infer tuples: input(header.uuid(\"X-Request-Id\")) returns Input<Headers1<UUID>, EmptyBody> automatically-no explicit types required. Use select in clients: exhaustively pattern match OneOf results to enforce business logic for every status. Return the right union option: when implementing generated controllers, wrap alternate responses in OneOfK.OptionN to keep tapik aware of which branch fired. Leverage codecs: bodies and headers carry codecs, so even custom AllOf combinations continue to encode/decode data safely. Understanding AllOf and OneOf is the key to appreciating tapik: the DSL describes APIs once, and the type system guarantees that every generated artifact agrees with the definition.

For local previews that include the API reference, run ./gradlew dokkaGenerate then ./docs/scripts/copy-api.sh after the Antora build. Releases use the current version. After a successful GitHub release, CI automatically runs ./gradlew bumpVersion (defaults to a patch bump) and pushes the commit to the target branch so new development starts with a higher version. For local bumps (e.g., pre-release rehearsal), run ./gradlew bumpVersion -PnewVersion=<nextVersion>; omit newVersion to auto-increment the patch. The task rewrites gradle.properties, docs (AsciiDoc/HTML), Gradle scripts, and properties files that mention the previous version while skipping build outputs and .gradle state. The task writes changes to disk; commit them along with any regenerated docs. Docs are published from release tags; they reflect the latest released version, not unreleased changes on main. Published docs are versioned with Antora: each release tag produces a version and the site default tracks the newest tag. Declare dependencies through the version catalog (gradle/libs.versions.toml). Reuse bundles like libs.bundles.testCommon to keep versions aligned. Avoid hard-coded coordinates in build scripts; prefer catalog aliases. Update or add tests that cover the behaviour you changed. Run ./gradlew ktlintFormat build and ensure both pass. Refresh generated outputs (tapikGenerate, Dokka) if your change affects them. Verify Antora builds locally (npm run docs:preview) when touching documentation. Craft concise, imperative commit messages (e.g., Add Spring WebMVC generator). Open a PR with intent, summary, linked issues, and screenshots/logs for user-visible changes. Request review from the relevant CODEOWNERS. By following these guidelines, you keep tapik’s generators deterministic, its DSL approachable, and its documentation trustworthy.","title":"Development & Contribution Guide","component":"tapik","version":"v0.2.2","name":"development","url":"/tapik/v0.2.2/development.html","titles":[{"text":"Repository Layout","hash":"_repository_layout","id":1},{"text":"Tooling & Commands","hash":"_tooling_commands","id":2},{"text":"Coding Standards","hash":"_coding_standards","id":3},{"text":"Testing","hash":"_testing","id":4},{"text":"Documentation Workflow","hash":"_documentation_workflow","id":5},{"text":"Versioning After Releases","hash":"_versioning_after_releases","id":6},{"text":"Dependency Management","hash":"_dependency_management","id":7},{"text":"Contribution Checklist","hash":"_contribution_checklist","id":8}]},"11":{"id":11,"text":"Welcome! This guide walks you through the smallest possible tapik project: adding the dependency, configuring the Gradle plugin, declaring an endpoint, and running the generators. You do not need prior knowledge of tapik-follow the numbered steps and you will generate code and documentation within minutes. tapik is split into JVM artifacts so you can pick only what your service requires: Use Case Dependency Define endpoints, parameters, headers, codecs implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.2\") Use ready-made string/byte codecs implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:codec:0.2.2\") Encode/decode JSON with Jackson implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.2\") Generate Spring RestClient clients implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:spring-restclient:0.2.2\") Generate Spring WebMVC controllers implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:spring-webmvc:0.2.2\") Add them to your build.gradle.kts alongside the Kotlin JVM plugin. tapik integrates with Gradle to scan compiled classes and run generators. Enable the plugin and declare the packages that contain your endpoints: plugins { id(\"dev.akif.tapik.plugin.gradle\") version \"0.2.2\" } dependencies { implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.2\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:codec:0.2.2\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.2\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:spring-restclient:0.2.2\") } tapik { endpointPackages(\"com.acme.catalog\") springRestClient { } markdownDocumentation { } } endpointPackages should include every package that holds val properties returning HttpEndpoint. Declaring springRestClient { } or markdownDocumentation { } is enough to opt into the corresponding generator; future options will live inside those blocks. Create a Kotlin file in src/main/kotlin/com/acme/catalog/ProductEndpoints.kt and describe the HTTP contract using the tapik DSL: package com.acme.catalog import dev.akif.tapik.* import dev.akif.tapik.codec.StringCodecs import dev.akif.tapik.jackson.jsonBody object ProductEndpoints { private val productId = path.uuid(\"productId\") val getProduct by endpoint( description = \"Fetch product details\", details = \"Returns localized information when the optional locale query parameter is supplied.\" ) { get(\"products\" / productId + query.string(\"locale\").optional(\"en-US\")) .input(header.uuid(\"X-Request-Id\")) .output(Status.OK) { jsonBody<ProductView>(\"product\") } .output(Status.NOT_FOUND) { jsonBody<ProblemDetails>(\"problem\") } } } The DSL captures everything tapik needs: Path and query parameters (with codecs and defaults). Request headers, bodies, media types. Response variants keyed by status matchers. Run the tapik task after the Kotlin compiler produces bytecode: ./gradlew tapikGenerate Behind the scenes the plugin: Scans compiled classes under the packages you configured.

New to tapik? Start with Getting Started for a step-by-step tutorial before diving into the full plugin reference below. JDK compatible with the repository defaults (javaTargetVersion=21, toolchain javaToolchainVersion=24 in gradle.properties). Gradle 9+ with the Kotlin DSL; configuration cache and task caching are supported out of the box. Kotlin 2.2.20 (supplied via the Gradle toolchain). Optional modules you plan to use, such as dev.akif.tapik:jackson for JSON bodies or Spring starters for generated code. Component Example Dependency Endpoint DSL implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.2\") Codecs implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:codec:0.2.2\") Jackson integration implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.2\") Gradle plugin id(\"dev.akif.tapik.plugin.gradle\") version \"0.2.2\" The version numbers match the repository snapshot (version=0.2.2). Replace them with the release you are consuming. Configure the plugin in a module that produces HTTP endpoints or needs generated sources: plugins { kotlin(\"jvm\") id(\"dev.akif.tapik.plugin.gradle\") version \"0.2.2\" } dependencies { implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.2\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.2\") // for JSON helpers } tapik { endpointPackages( \"com.acme.catalog.endpoints\", \"com.acme.shared.http\" ) springRestClient { /* enables the Spring RestClient generator */ } springWebMvc { /* enables the Spring WebMVC generator */ } markdownDocumentation { /* enables the Markdown documentation generator */ } } Key things to remember: endpointPackages must reference the packages where compiled endpoint properties live. The scanner filters classes using these prefixes. The nested generator blocks are markers; you do not need to configure anything inside them unless future versions expose options. Generated Kotlin sources land under build/generated/sources/tapik/main/kotlin and are added to the main source set automatically. Non-source artefacts (for example, Markdown files) are written under build/generated. Endpoints are compile-time constants built with the DSL in the core module. The DSL collects metadata from property names, documentation strings, and nested builders. package com.acme.catalog.endpoints import dev.akif.tapik.* import dev.akif.tapik.jackson.jsonBody object ProductEndpoints { private val productId = path.uuid(\"productId\") private val locale = query.string(\"locale\").optional(\"en-US\") val getProduct by endpoint( description = \"Fetch product details\", details = \"Returns localized information when the locale query parameter is supplied.\" ) { get(\"products\" / productId + locale) .input(header.uuid(\"X-Request-Id\")) .output(Status.OK) { jsonBody<ProductView>(\"product\") } .output(Status.NOT_FOUND) { jsonBody<ProblemDetails>(\"problem\") } } } Highlights: endpoint { ... } infers the endpoint id from the property name (getProduct). The description and details flow into generated KDoc and Markdown. Path building uses operator overloads: \"products\" / productId. Query parameters append with , headers with +input { ... }, and outputs use output(Status.OK) { ... }. Response variants can be chained; the DSL supports OneOf unions to model branching behaviour. tapik registers an aggregated tapikGenerate task. It depends on classes for the current project and its siblings to ensure bytecode is available. ./gradlew :service:tapikGenerate Execution flow: Compiled classes are scanned for properties that return HttpEndpoint. Metadata describing the endpoints is persisted to build/generated/tapik-endpoints.txt. The selected generators (spring-restclient, spring-webmvc, markdown-docs) run sequentially. Generated sources are attached to the IDE/classpath; you can ./gradlew build without special configuration. You can run ./gradlew :service:classes tapikGenerate during fast feedback loops. Pass -PskipLint if you want to avoid ktlint locally. Kotlin sources live under build/generated/sources/tapik/main/kotlin. Markdown documentation is emitted to build/generated/API.md. Scan report: build/generated/tapik-endpoints.txt contains the raw metadata list. When checking generated Kotlin into source control: Run ./gradlew tapikGenerate after any endpoint changes. Review generated types as you would review hand-written code; they carry KDoc extracted from your endpoints. For reproducibility, make sure the versions of tapik dependencies are pinned via a version catalog or BOM. Symptom Common Cause Fix Missing compiled classes warning classes task did not run before tapikGenerate Run ./gradlew classes tapikGenerate or wire tasks in your CI pipeline No generators execute Generator blocks omitted in the tapik extension Add springRestClient { }, springWebMvc { }, or markdownDocumentation { } Class not found during scan Endpoint package not covered by endpointPackages Ensure fully qualified package prefixes are listed Unexpected HTTP mappings Endpoint path missing leading segment Start URIs with \"segment\" or \"segment\" / ...

Headers are encoded via the Input.encodeInputHeaders helpers from core; responses use the decodeHeadersX utilities to validate and decode header values. Bodies use the codec attached to the Body definition (for example, Jackson-based JSON codecs). Any CodecFailure surfaces as an IllegalStateException in generated code so mismatches fail fast. RestClientInterpreter validates response status codes and media types before the generator attempts to decode bodies, surfacing detailed RestClientResponseException messages when mismatches occur. Create a Spring-managed implementation by delegating to the generated interface: @Component class HttpProductClient( override val restClient: RestClient ) : ProductEndpointsClient RestClientBasedClient provides interpreter automatically, so implementations only supply the RestClient. You may inject a configured RestClient.Builder or reuse the application-wide client. Drive endpoint behaviour through unit tests on the DSL before running code generation. Use Spring’s MockRestServiceServer to verify generated clients: intercept outgoing requests, assert the expected path/headers/body, and feed back fixtures that satisfy your endpoint outputs. If you customise codecs, add integration tests to ensure RestClientInterpreter can successfully decode the wire format. Provide your own RestClient (set timeouts, interceptors, authentication) while reusing generated code. Override functions in the generated interface by writing extension functions or wrapping the generated interface inside a higher-level service. Add new generators for other HTTP client stacks by following the steps in Code Generation Overview; the Spring client serves as a realistic template.","title":"Spring RestClient Clients","component":"tapik","version":"v0.2.2","name":"client","url":"/tapik/v0.2.2/code-generation/client.html","titles":[{"text":"Generated Structure","hash":"_generated_structure","id":1},{"text":"Return Types","hash":"_return_types","id":2},{"text":"Header and Body Handling","hash":"_header_and_body_handling","id":3},{"text":"Instantiating Clients","hash":"_instantiating_clients","id":4},{"text":"Testing Tips","hash":"_testing_tips","id":5},{"text":"Customisation Hooks","hash":"_customisation_hooks","id":6}]},"15":{"id":15,"text":"tapik ships a Markdown generator (markdown-docs) that produces a lightweight API reference from your endpoint definitions.

Implement the generated interfaces to keep routing, validation, and response typing aligned with the DSL. Location: build/generated/sources/tapik/main/kotlin/<package>/<SourceFile>Controller.kt Interface name: <SourceFile>Controller Annotations: Each method is decorated with the appropriate @GetMapping, @PostMapping, …​ annotations derived from the endpoint metadata, including path, consumes, and produces attributes. Parameters: Path variables receive @SpringPathVariable, query parameters use @RequestParam, headers use @RequestHeader, and bodies use @RequestBody. Default values defined in the DSL are carried into the annotation attributes. Return type: Methods return tapik ResponseX or ResponseWithoutBodyX types. When multiple outputs exist, the return type is OneOfK<...> containing those responses. Example excerpt: interface ProductEndpointsController { /** * Fetch product details. */ @GetMapping( path = [\"/products/{productId}\"], produces = [\"application/json\"] ) fun getProduct( @SpringPathVariable(\"productId\") productId: UUID, @RequestParam(name = \"locale\", required = false, defaultValue = \"en-US\") locale: String, @RequestHeader(name = \"X-Request-Id\") xRequestId: UUID ): Response0<ProductView> } Wire an implementation in your Spring application: @Component class ProductHandler : ProductEndpointsController { override fun getProduct( productId: UUID, locale: String, xRequestId: UUID ): Response0<ProductView> { // fetch domain model and map it into the tapik response type val product = service.lookup(productId, locale) return Response0(Status.OK, product) } } The return value captures the HTTP status, headers, and body exactly as you modelled them in the DSL. Use helper builders from dev.akif.tapik (for example, Response0, ResponseWithoutBody1, OneOf2.Option1) to produce the response variant that matches the status you intend to emit. Create a lightweight HTTP adapter that converts the tapik response to a Spring ResponseEntity using the extensions in TapikResponseEntity.kt: @RestController class ProductController( private val handler: ProductHandler ) { @GetMapping(\"/products/{productId}\") fun getProduct( productId: UUID, locale: String, xRequestId: UUID ): ResponseEntity<Any?> = ProductEndpoints.getProduct.toResponseEntity( handler.getProduct(productId, locale, xRequestId) ) } toResponseEntity(Response<*>) handles single-output endpoints. toResponseEntity(OneOf) handles multi-output unions. Status and media-type conversions rely on Status.toHttpStatus() and MediaType.toSpringMediaType() helpers bundled with the generator. toResponseEntity enforces that your implementation returns the declared number of headers and selects the matching output variant for OneOf unions. If a mismatch occurs (for example, returning Option2 while only one output is defined), the helper throws an error pointing at the offending endpoint. Reuse DSL metadata: The generated interface references the HttpEndpoint instances, so you can lean on .outputs or .parameters inside your implementation for additional logic (for example, building links). Combine with Spring validation: Annotate generated parameters with additional validation annotations (e.g., @Valid, @NotBlank) in partial classes or wrapper controllers if you need extra constraints. Return domain models: The response builders accept your domain types. Keep encoding logic inside the DSL via codecs so controller implementations stay small. Unit-test with tapik types: Write tests against the generated interface contracts to verify that every response path returns the appropriate Response* wrapper. Pair with the toResponseEntity helper for end-to-end tests. The generator chooses method-level annotations based on the HTTP verb. For uncommon verbs (such as OPTIONS or TRACE), it emits @RequestMapping(method = [RequestMethod.VERB], path = [...]). If you need additional attributes (for example, security annotations or custom @CrossOrigin settings), declare them in your concrete controller implementation-interfaces are kept lean on purpose.","title":"Spring WebMVC Controllers","component":"tapik","version":"v0.2.2","name":"server","url":"/tapik/v0.2.2/code-generation/server.html","titles":[{"text":"Generated Structure","hash":"_generated_structure","id":1},{"text":"Implementing Controllers","hash":"_implementing_controllers","id":2},{"text":"Rendering Spring Responses","hash":"_rendering_spring_responses","id":3},{"text":"Status and Header Validation","hash":"_status_and_header_validation","id":4},{"text":"Tips for Server Implementations","hash":"_tips_for_server_implementations","id":5},{"text":"Customising Routing","hash":"_customising_routing","id":6}]},"18":{"id":18,"text":"tapik’s primary goal is to keep HTTP contracts type-safe from declaration to runtime. The DSL models every piece of an endpoint-parameters, headers, bodies, and response branches-with immutable, strongly-typed structures. Generators rely on these structures to emit Kotlin that cannot drift from the original definition. Concept Interface Purpose Common Aliases Heterogeneous tuple (product) AllOf Represents all items that must exist together Parameters, Headers, Outputs, HeaderValues, Responses Discriminated union (sum) OneOf Represents one branch chosen at runtime OneOf2, OneOf3, …​ up to OneOf10 AllOf is a family of interfaces (AllOf0 …​ AllOf10) with itemN accessors. Concrete tapik types reuse these through the Tuple facade so you do not manipulate AllOf directly. typealias Headers3<H1, H2, H3> = Tuple3<Header<*>, Header<H1>, Header<H2>, Header<H3>> Because Headers3 implements AllOf4, the compiler knows: headers.item1 is the first Header<*>. headers.item2 is Header<H1>, preserving the codec type. Iteration is still possible via the Listable interface. tapik ships aliases for each arity so you can declare headers, parameters, and responses without manual tuple plumbing: Alias Description Parameters0 …​ Parameters10 Path/query parameter definitions Headers0 …​ Headers10 Request header definitions HeaderValues0 …​ HeaderValues10 Decoded inbound header values Outputs0 …​ Outputs10 Ordered list of (StatusMatcher, Headers, Body) combinations Response0 / ResponseWithoutBody0 families Runtime responses returned by generated code OneOf models exclusive branches. Each arity exposes inline OptionN value classes and a select helper for exhaustive handling. fun interpret(result: OneOf3<Response0<User>, ResponseWithoutBody0, ResponseWithoutBody0>) = result.select( when1 = { response -> \"Found user ${response.body.id}\" }, when2 = { \"User missing\" }, when3 = { \"User deleted\" } ) Generators lean on these unions in two places: Client code returns OneOfK when an endpoint declares multiple outputs, forcing call sites to handle every status path. Server code expects implementers to return the matching OptionN when emitting a non-default response, ensuring real runtime branches align with the DSL. Outputs is an AllOf tuple of Output definitions. At runtime, responses are wrapped in either a concrete ResponseX (single output) or a OneOfK<ResponseX, ...> (multiple outputs). This combination gives tapik strong guarantees: The number and order of outputs in the DSL matches the generated code and Markdown documentation. Header codecs are preserved all the way to runtime decoding (decodeHeadersN). Exhaustive select calls mean adding a new output is a compile-time change for every consumer. flowchart TD DSL[\"HttpEndpoint DSL\"] --> Tuple[\"Tuple / AllOf metadata\"] Tuple --> Outputs[\"Outputs tuple\"] Outputs -->|single| Response[\"ResponseX\"] Outputs -->|multiple| Union[\"OneOfK ResponseX\"] Response --> Client[\"Generated client\"] Union --> Client Response --> Server[\"Generated controller\"] Union --> Server Prefer aliases: use Headers3 instead of wiring Tuple3 manually. The aliases pick correct variance and marker interfaces. Let the DSL infer tuples: input(header.uuid(\"X-Request-Id\")) returns Input<Headers1<UUID>, EmptyBody> automatically-no explicit types required. Use select in clients: exhaustively pattern match OneOf results to enforce business logic for every status. Return the right union option: when implementing generated controllers, wrap alternate responses in OneOfK.OptionN to keep tapik aware of which branch fired. Leverage codecs: bodies and headers carry codecs, so even custom AllOf combinations continue to encode/decode data safely. Understanding AllOf and OneOf is the key to appreciating tapik: the DSL describes APIs once, and the type system guarantees that every generated artifact agrees with the definition.

Disable configuration cache while debugging with -Dorg.gradle.configuration-cache=false. Plugin validation runs only when -PrunPluginValidation is set. Kotlin style follows .editorconfig (4-space indent, 120-char lines, LF endings). Avoid wildcard imports unless they simplify tapik package usage. Keep packages under dev.akif.tapik.<module>; respect the flattened directory structure. Document every public API with KDoc, including type parameters, parameters, returns, and throws. Generated sources belong under build/ or generated/; keep them out of VCS unless explicitly required. Use kotlin(\"test\") with JUnit 5 (junit-jupiter-params for parameterized cases). Place unit tests adjacent to the module (src/test/kotlin). For focused runs: ./gradlew :module:test. Integration flows (e.g., Spring-specific) should live in dedicated source sets such as integrationTest. Favour descriptive test names that outline behaviour rather than method names. Update KDoc and run ./gradlew dokkaGenerateHtml before shipping changes. Rebuild the Antora site (npm run docs:preview) locally if you modify AsciiDoc or navigation. Generated documentation must include the footer © {currentYear} Mehmet Akif Tütüncü; the Dokka configuration enforces it - do not strip it. For local previews that include the API reference, run ./gradlew dokkaGenerate then ./docs/scripts/copy-api.sh after the Antora build. Releases use the current version. After a successful GitHub release, CI automatically runs ./gradlew bumpVersion (defaults to a patch bump) and pushes the commit to the target branch so new development starts with a higher version. For local bumps (e.g., pre-release rehearsal), run ./gradlew bumpVersion -PnewVersion=<nextVersion>; omit newVersion to auto-increment the patch. The task rewrites gradle.properties, docs (AsciiDoc/HTML), Gradle scripts, and properties files that mention the previous version while skipping build outputs and .gradle state. The task writes changes to disk; commit them along with any regenerated docs. Docs are published from release tags; they reflect the latest released version, not unreleased changes on main. Published docs are versioned with Antora: each release tag produces a version and the site default tracks the newest tag. Tags before v0.2.1 lack docs/antora.yml, so the Antora playbooks explicitly exclude v0.1.* and v0.2.0. Declare dependencies through the version catalog (gradle/libs.versions.toml). Reuse bundles like libs.bundles.testCommon to keep versions aligned. Avoid hard-coded coordinates in build scripts; prefer catalog aliases. Update or add tests that cover the behaviour you changed. Run ./gradlew ktlintFormat build and ensure both pass. Refresh generated outputs (tapikGenerate, Dokka) if your change affects them. Verify Antora builds locally (npm run docs:preview) when touching documentation. Craft concise, imperative commit messages (e.g., Add Spring WebMVC generator). Open a PR with intent, summary, linked issues, and screenshots/logs for user-visible changes. Request review from the relevant CODEOWNERS. By following these guidelines, you keep tapik’s generators deterministic, its DSL approachable, and its documentation trustworthy.","title":"Development & Contribution Guide","component":"tapik","version":"v0.2.3","name":"development","url":"/tapik/v0.2.3/development.html","titles":[{"text":"Repository Layout","hash":"_repository_layout","id":1},{"text":"Tooling & Commands","hash":"_tooling_commands","id":2},{"text":"Coding Standards","hash":"_coding_standards","id":3},{"text":"Testing","hash":"_testing","id":4},{"text":"Documentation Workflow","hash":"_documentation_workflow","id":5},{"text":"Versioning After Releases","hash":"_versioning_after_releases","id":6},{"text":"Dependency Management","hash":"_dependency_management","id":7},{"text":"Contribution Checklist","hash":"_contribution_checklist","id":8}]},"20":{"id":20,"text":"Welcome! This guide walks you through the smallest possible tapik project: adding the dependency, configuring the Gradle plugin, declaring an endpoint, and running the generators. You do not need prior knowledge of tapik-follow the numbered steps and you will generate code and documentation within minutes. tapik is split into JVM artifacts so you can pick only what your service requires: Use Case Dependency Define endpoints, parameters, headers, codecs implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.3\") Use ready-made string/byte codecs implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:codec:0.2.3\") Encode/decode JSON with Jackson implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.3\") Generate Spring RestClient clients implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:spring-restclient:0.2.3\") Generate Spring WebMVC controllers implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:spring-webmvc:0.2.3\") Add them to your build.gradle.kts alongside the Kotlin JVM plugin. tapik integrates with Gradle to scan compiled classes and run generators. Enable the plugin and declare the packages that contain your endpoints: plugins { id(\"dev.akif.tapik.plugin.gradle\") version \"0.2.3\" } dependencies { implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.3\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:codec:0.2.3\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.3\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:spring-restclient:0.2.3\") } tapik { endpointPackages(\"com.acme.catalog\") springRestClient { } markdownDocumentation { } } endpointPackages should include every package that holds val properties returning HttpEndpoint. Declaring springRestClient { } or markdownDocumentation { } is enough to opt into the corresponding generator; future options will live inside those blocks. Create a Kotlin file in src/main/kotlin/com/acme/catalog/ProductEndpoints.kt and describe the HTTP contract using the tapik DSL: package com.acme.catalog import dev.akif.tapik.* import dev.akif.tapik.codec.StringCodecs import dev.akif.tapik.jackson.jsonBody object ProductEndpoints { private val productId = path.uuid(\"productId\") val getProduct by endpoint( description = \"Fetch product details\", details = \"Returns localized information when the optional locale query parameter is supplied.\" ) { get(\"products\" / productId + query.string(\"locale\").optional(\"en-US\")) .input(header.uuid(\"X-Request-Id\")) .output(Status.OK) { jsonBody<ProductView>(\"product\") } .output(Status.NOT_FOUND) { jsonBody<ProblemDetails>(\"problem\") } } } The DSL captures everything tapik needs: Path and query parameters (with codecs and defaults). Request headers, bodies, media types. Response variants keyed by status matchers. Run the tapik task after the Kotlin compiler produces bytecode: ./gradlew tapikGenerate Behind the scenes the plugin: Scans compiled classes under the packages you configured.

New to tapik? Start with Getting Started for a step-by-step tutorial before diving into the full plugin reference below. JDK compatible with the repository defaults (javaTargetVersion=21, toolchain javaToolchainVersion=24 in gradle.properties). Gradle 9+ with the Kotlin DSL; configuration cache and task caching are supported out of the box. Kotlin 2.2.20 (supplied via the Gradle toolchain). Optional modules you plan to use, such as dev.akif.tapik:jackson for JSON bodies or Spring starters for generated code. Component Example Dependency Endpoint DSL implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.3\") Codecs implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:codec:0.2.3\") Jackson integration implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.3\") Gradle plugin id(\"dev.akif.tapik.plugin.gradle\") version \"0.2.3\" The version numbers match the repository snapshot (version=0.2.3). Replace them with the release you are consuming. Configure the plugin in a module that produces HTTP endpoints or needs generated sources: plugins { kotlin(\"jvm\") id(\"dev.akif.tapik.plugin.gradle\") version \"0.2.3\" } dependencies { implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.3\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.3\") // for JSON helpers } tapik { endpointPackages( \"com.acme.catalog.endpoints\", \"com.acme.shared.http\" ) springRestClient { /* enables the Spring RestClient generator */ } springWebMvc { /* enables the Spring WebMVC generator */ } markdownDocumentation { /* enables the Markdown documentation generator */ } } Key things to remember: endpointPackages must reference the packages where compiled endpoint properties live. The scanner filters classes using these prefixes. The nested generator blocks are markers; you do not need to configure anything inside them unless future versions expose options. Generated Kotlin sources land under build/generated/sources/tapik/main/kotlin and are added to the main source set automatically. Non-source artefacts (for example, Markdown files) are written under build/generated. Endpoints are compile-time constants built with the DSL in the core module. The DSL collects metadata from property names, documentation strings, and nested builders. package com.acme.catalog.endpoints import dev.akif.tapik.* import dev.akif.tapik.jackson.jsonBody object ProductEndpoints { private val productId = path.uuid(\"productId\") private val locale = query.string(\"locale\").optional(\"en-US\") val getProduct by endpoint( description = \"Fetch product details\", details = \"Returns localized information when the locale query parameter is supplied.\" ) { get(\"products\" / productId + locale) .input(header.uuid(\"X-Request-Id\")) .output(Status.OK) { jsonBody<ProductView>(\"product\") } .output(Status.NOT_FOUND) { jsonBody<ProblemDetails>(\"problem\") } } } Highlights: endpoint { ... } infers the endpoint id from the property name (getProduct). The description and details flow into generated KDoc and Markdown. Path building uses operator overloads: \"products\" / productId. Query parameters append with , headers with +input { ... }, and outputs use output(Status.OK) { ... }. Response variants can be chained; the DSL supports OneOf unions to model branching behaviour. tapik registers an aggregated tapikGenerate task. It depends on classes for the current project and its siblings to ensure bytecode is available. ./gradlew :service:tapikGenerate Execution flow: Compiled classes are scanned for properties that return HttpEndpoint. Metadata describing the endpoints is persisted to build/generated/tapik-endpoints.txt. The selected generators (spring-restclient, spring-webmvc, markdown-docs) run sequentially. Generated sources are attached to the IDE/classpath; you can ./gradlew build without special configuration. You can run ./gradlew :service:classes tapikGenerate during fast feedback loops. Pass -PskipLint if you want to avoid ktlint locally. Kotlin sources live under build/generated/sources/tapik/main/kotlin. Markdown documentation is emitted to build/generated/API.md. Scan report: build/generated/tapik-endpoints.txt contains the raw metadata list. When checking generated Kotlin into source control: Run ./gradlew tapikGenerate after any endpoint changes. Review generated types as you would review hand-written code; they carry KDoc extracted from your endpoints. For reproducibility, make sure the versions of tapik dependencies are pinned via a version catalog or BOM. Symptom Common Cause Fix Missing compiled classes warning classes task did not run before tapikGenerate Run ./gradlew classes tapikGenerate or wire tasks in your CI pipeline No generators execute Generator blocks omitted in the tapik extension Add springRestClient { }, springWebMvc { }, or markdownDocumentation { } Class not found during scan Endpoint package not covered by endpointPackages Ensure fully qualified package prefixes are listed Unexpected HTTP mappings Endpoint path missing leading segment Start URIs with \"segment\" or \"segment\" / ...

Headers are encoded via the Input.encodeInputHeaders helpers from core; responses use the decodeHeadersX utilities to validate and decode header values. Bodies use the codec attached to the Body definition (for example, Jackson-based JSON codecs). Any CodecFailure surfaces as an IllegalStateException in generated code so mismatches fail fast. RestClientInterpreter validates response status codes and media types before the generator attempts to decode bodies, surfacing detailed RestClientResponseException messages when mismatches occur. Create a Spring-managed implementation by delegating to the generated interface: @Component class HttpProductClient( override val restClient: RestClient ) : ProductEndpointsClient RestClientBasedClient provides interpreter automatically, so implementations only supply the RestClient. You may inject a configured RestClient.Builder or reuse the application-wide client. Drive endpoint behaviour through unit tests on the DSL before running code generation. Use Spring’s MockRestServiceServer to verify generated clients: intercept outgoing requests, assert the expected path/headers/body, and feed back fixtures that satisfy your endpoint outputs. If you customise codecs, add integration tests to ensure RestClientInterpreter can successfully decode the wire format. Provide your own RestClient (set timeouts, interceptors, authentication) while reusing generated code. Override functions in the generated interface by writing extension functions or wrapping the generated interface inside a higher-level service. Add new generators for other HTTP client stacks by following the steps in Code Generation Overview; the Spring client serves as a realistic template.","title":"Spring RestClient Clients","component":"tapik","version":"v0.2.3","name":"client","url":"/tapik/v0.2.3/code-generation/client.html","titles":[{"text":"Generated Structure","hash":"_generated_structure","id":1},{"text":"Return Types","hash":"_return_types","id":2},{"text":"Header and Body Handling","hash":"_header_and_body_handling","id":3},{"text":"Instantiating Clients","hash":"_instantiating_clients","id":4},{"text":"Testing Tips","hash":"_testing_tips","id":5},{"text":"Customisation Hooks","hash":"_customisation_hooks","id":6}]},"24":{"id":24,"text":"tapik ships a Markdown generator (markdown-docs) that produces a lightweight API reference from your endpoint definitions.

Implement the generated interfaces to keep routing, validation, and response typing aligned with the DSL. Location: build/generated/sources/tapik/main/kotlin/<package>/<SourceFile>Controller.kt Interface name: <SourceFile>Controller Annotations: Each method is decorated with the appropriate @GetMapping, @PostMapping, …​ annotations derived from the endpoint metadata, including path, consumes, and produces attributes. Parameters: Path variables receive @SpringPathVariable, query parameters use @RequestParam, headers use @RequestHeader, and bodies use @RequestBody. Default values defined in the DSL are carried into the annotation attributes. Return type: Methods return tapik ResponseX or ResponseWithoutBodyX types. When multiple outputs exist, the return type is OneOfK<...> containing those responses. Example excerpt: interface ProductEndpointsController { /** * Fetch product details. */ @GetMapping( path = [\"/products/{productId}\"], produces = [\"application/json\"] ) fun getProduct( @SpringPathVariable(\"productId\") productId: UUID, @RequestParam(name = \"locale\", required = false, defaultValue = \"en-US\") locale: String, @RequestHeader(name = \"X-Request-Id\") xRequestId: UUID ): Response0<ProductView> } Wire an implementation in your Spring application: @Component class ProductHandler : ProductEndpointsController { override fun getProduct( productId: UUID, locale: String, xRequestId: UUID ): Response0<ProductView> { // fetch domain model and map it into the tapik response type val product = service.lookup(productId, locale) return Response0(Status.OK, product) } } The return value captures the HTTP status, headers, and body exactly as you modelled them in the DSL. Use helper builders from dev.akif.tapik (for example, Response0, ResponseWithoutBody1, OneOf2.Option1) to produce the response variant that matches the status you intend to emit. Create a lightweight HTTP adapter that converts the tapik response to a Spring ResponseEntity using the extensions in TapikResponseEntity.kt: @RestController class ProductController( private val handler: ProductHandler ) { @GetMapping(\"/products/{productId}\") fun getProduct( productId: UUID, locale: String, xRequestId: UUID ): ResponseEntity<Any?> = ProductEndpoints.getProduct.toResponseEntity( handler.getProduct(productId, locale, xRequestId) ) } toResponseEntity(Response<*>) handles single-output endpoints. toResponseEntity(OneOf) handles multi-output unions. Status and media-type conversions rely on Status.toHttpStatus() and MediaType.toSpringMediaType() helpers bundled with the generator. toResponseEntity enforces that your implementation returns the declared number of headers and selects the matching output variant for OneOf unions. If a mismatch occurs (for example, returning Option2 while only one output is defined), the helper throws an error pointing at the offending endpoint. Reuse DSL metadata: The generated interface references the HttpEndpoint instances, so you can lean on .outputs or .parameters inside your implementation for additional logic (for example, building links). Combine with Spring validation: Annotate generated parameters with additional validation annotations (e.g., @Valid, @NotBlank) in partial classes or wrapper controllers if you need extra constraints. Return domain models: The response builders accept your domain types. Keep encoding logic inside the DSL via codecs so controller implementations stay small. Unit-test with tapik types: Write tests against the generated interface contracts to verify that every response path returns the appropriate Response* wrapper. Pair with the toResponseEntity helper for end-to-end tests. The generator chooses method-level annotations based on the HTTP verb. For uncommon verbs (such as OPTIONS or TRACE), it emits @RequestMapping(method = [RequestMethod.VERB], path = [...]). If you need additional attributes (for example, security annotations or custom @CrossOrigin settings), declare them in your concrete controller implementation-interfaces are kept lean on purpose.","title":"Spring WebMVC Controllers","component":"tapik","version":"v0.2.3","name":"server","url":"/tapik/v0.2.3/code-generation/server.html","titles":[{"text":"Generated Structure","hash":"_generated_structure","id":1},{"text":"Implementing Controllers","hash":"_implementing_controllers","id":2},{"text":"Rendering Spring Responses","hash":"_rendering_spring_responses","id":3},{"text":"Status and Header Validation","hash":"_status_and_header_validation","id":4},{"text":"Tips for Server Implementations","hash":"_tips_for_server_implementations","id":5},{"text":"Customising Routing","hash":"_customising_routing","id":6}]},"27":{"id":27,"text":"tapik’s primary goal is to keep HTTP contracts type-safe from declaration to runtime.

Each arity exposes inline OptionN value classes and a select helper for exhaustive handling. fun interpret(result: OneOf3<Response0<User>, ResponseWithoutBody0, ResponseWithoutBody0>) = result.select( when1 = { response -> \"Found user ${response.body.id}\" }, when2 = { \"User missing\" }, when3 = { \"User deleted\" } ) Generators lean on these unions in two places: Client code returns OneOfK when an endpoint declares multiple outputs, forcing call sites to handle every status path. Server code expects implementers to return the matching OptionN when emitting a non-default response, ensuring real runtime branches align with the DSL. Outputs is an AllOf tuple of Output definitions. At runtime, responses are wrapped in either a concrete ResponseX (single output) or a OneOfK<ResponseX, ...> (multiple outputs). This combination gives tapik strong guarantees: The number and order of outputs in the DSL matches the generated code and Markdown documentation. Header codecs are preserved all the way to runtime decoding (decodeHeadersN). Exhaustive select calls mean adding a new output is a compile-time change for every consumer. flowchart TD DSL[\"HttpEndpoint DSL\"] --> Tuple[\"Tuple / AllOf metadata\"] Tuple --> Outputs[\"Outputs tuple\"] Outputs -->|single| Response[\"ResponseX\"] Outputs -->|multiple| Union[\"OneOfK ResponseX\"] Response --> Client[\"Generated client\"] Union --> Client Response --> Server[\"Generated controller\"] Union --> Server Prefer aliases: use Headers3 instead of wiring Tuple3 manually. The aliases pick correct variance and marker interfaces. Let the DSL infer tuples: input(header.uuid(\"X-Request-Id\")) returns Input<Headers1<UUID>, EmptyBody> automatically-no explicit types required. Use select in clients: exhaustively pattern match OneOf results to enforce business logic for every status. Return the right union option: when implementing generated controllers, wrap alternate responses in OneOfK.OptionN to keep tapik aware of which branch fired. Leverage codecs: bodies and headers carry codecs, so even custom AllOf combinations continue to encode/decode data safely. Understanding AllOf and OneOf is the key to appreciating tapik: the DSL describes APIs once, and the type system guarantees that every generated artifact agrees with the definition. Take a look at the runtime helpers (EncodeHeadersMethods.kt, DecodeHeadersMethods.kt, Responses.kt) if you want to explore further.","title":"Type Safety in tapik","component":"tapik","version":"v0.2.3","name":"type-safety","url":"/tapik/v0.2.3/concepts/type-safety.html","titles":[{"text":"Building Blocks","hash":"_building_blocks","id":1},{"text":"AllOf and Tuple Aliases","hash":"_allof_and_tuple_aliases","id":2},{"text":"OneOf and Conditional Responses","hash":"_oneof_and_conditional_responses","id":3},{"text":"AllOf + OneOf Together","hash":"_allof_oneof_together","id":4},{"text":"Tips for Working with These Types","hash":"_tips_for_working_with_these_types","id":5}]},"28":{"id":28,"text":"tapik uses a multi-module Gradle build with Kotlin DSL, configuration cache, and extensive code generation.

Disable configuration cache while debugging with -Dorg.gradle.configuration-cache=false. Plugin validation runs only when -PrunPluginValidation is set. Kotlin style follows .editorconfig (4-space indent, 120-char lines, LF endings). Avoid wildcard imports unless they simplify tapik package usage. Keep packages under dev.akif.tapik.<module>; respect the flattened directory structure. Document every public API with KDoc, including type parameters, parameters, returns, and throws. Generated sources belong under build/ or generated/; keep them out of VCS unless explicitly required. Use kotlin(\"test\") with JUnit 5 (junit-jupiter-params for parameterized cases). Place unit tests adjacent to the module (src/test/kotlin). For focused runs: ./gradlew :module:test. Integration flows (e.g., Spring-specific) should live in dedicated source sets such as integrationTest. Favour descriptive test names that outline behaviour rather than method names. Update KDoc and run ./gradlew dokkaGenerateHtml before shipping changes. Rebuild the Antora site (npm run docs:preview) locally if you modify AsciiDoc or navigation. Generated documentation must include the footer © {currentYear} Mehmet Akif Tütüncü; the Dokka configuration enforces it - do not strip it. For local previews that include the API reference, run ./gradlew dokkaGenerate then ./docs/scripts/copy-api.sh after the Antora build. Releases use the current version. After a successful GitHub release, CI automatically runs ./gradlew bumpVersion (defaults to a patch bump) and pushes the commit to the target branch so new development starts with a higher version. For local bumps (e.g., pre-release rehearsal), run ./gradlew bumpVersion -PnewVersion=<nextVersion>; omit newVersion to auto-increment the patch. The task rewrites gradle.properties, docs (AsciiDoc/HTML), Gradle scripts, and properties files that mention the previous version while skipping build outputs and .gradle state. The task writes changes to disk; commit them along with any regenerated docs. Docs are published from release tags; they reflect the latest released version, not unreleased changes on main. Published docs are versioned with Antora: each release tag produces a version and the site default tracks the newest tag. Tags before v0.2.1 lack docs/antora.yml, so the Antora playbooks explicitly exclude v0.1.* and v0.2.0. Declare dependencies through the version catalog (gradle/libs.versions.toml). Reuse bundles like libs.bundles.testCommon to keep versions aligned. Avoid hard-coded coordinates in build scripts; prefer catalog aliases. Update or add tests that cover the behaviour you changed. Run ./gradlew ktlintFormat build and ensure both pass. Refresh generated outputs (tapikGenerate, Dokka) if your change affects them. Verify Antora builds locally (npm run docs:preview) when touching documentation. Craft concise, imperative commit messages (e.g., Add Spring WebMVC generator). Open a PR with intent, summary, linked issues, and screenshots/logs for user-visible changes. Request review from the relevant CODEOWNERS. By following these guidelines, you keep tapik’s generators deterministic, its DSL approachable, and its documentation trustworthy.","title":"Development & Contribution Guide","component":"tapik","version":"v0.2.4","name":"development","url":"/tapik/v0.2.4/development.html","titles":[{"text":"Repository Layout","hash":"_repository_layout","id":1},{"text":"Tooling & Commands","hash":"_tooling_commands","id":2},{"text":"Coding Standards","hash":"_coding_standards","id":3},{"text":"Testing","hash":"_testing","id":4},{"text":"Documentation Workflow","hash":"_documentation_workflow","id":5},{"text":"Versioning After Releases","hash":"_versioning_after_releases","id":6},{"text":"Dependency Management","hash":"_dependency_management","id":7},{"text":"Contribution Checklist","hash":"_contribution_checklist","id":8}]},"29":{"id":29,"text":"Welcome! This guide walks you through the smallest possible tapik project: adding the dependency, configuring the Gradle plugin, declaring an endpoint, and running the generators. You do not need prior knowledge of tapik-follow the numbered steps and you will generate code and documentation within minutes. tapik is split into JVM artifacts so you can pick only what your service requires: Use Case Dependency Define endpoints, parameters, headers, codecs implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.4\") Use ready-made string/byte codecs implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:codec:0.2.4\") Encode/decode JSON with Jackson implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.4\") Generate Spring RestClient clients implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:spring-restclient:0.2.4\") Generate Spring WebMVC controllers implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:spring-webmvc:0.2.4\") Add them to your build.gradle.kts alongside the Kotlin JVM plugin. tapik integrates with Gradle to scan compiled classes and run generators. Enable the plugin and declare the packages that contain your endpoints: plugins { id(\"dev.akif.tapik.plugin.gradle\") version \"0.2.4\" } dependencies { implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.4\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:codec:0.2.4\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.4\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:spring-restclient:0.2.4\") } tapik { endpointPackages(\"com.acme.catalog\") springRestClient { } markdownDocumentation { } } endpointPackages should include every package that holds val properties returning HttpEndpoint. Declaring springRestClient { } or markdownDocumentation { } is enough to opt into the corresponding generator; future options will live inside those blocks. Create a Kotlin file in src/main/kotlin/com/acme/catalog/ProductEndpoints.kt and describe the HTTP contract using the tapik DSL: package com.acme.catalog import dev.akif.tapik.* import dev.akif.tapik.codec.StringCodecs import dev.akif.tapik.jackson.jsonBody object ProductEndpoints { private val productId = path.uuid(\"productId\") val getProduct by endpoint( description = \"Fetch product details\", details = \"Returns localized information when the optional locale query parameter is supplied.\" ) { get(\"products\" / productId + query.string(\"locale\").optional(\"en-US\")) .input(header.uuid(\"X-Request-Id\")) .output(Status.OK) { jsonBody<ProductView>(\"product\") } .output(Status.NOT_FOUND) { jsonBody<ProblemDetails>(\"problem\") } } } The DSL captures everything tapik needs: Path and query parameters (with codecs and defaults). Request headers, bodies, media types. Response variants keyed by status matchers. Run the tapik task after the Kotlin compiler produces bytecode: ./gradlew tapikGenerate Behind the scenes the plugin: Scans compiled classes under the packages you configured.

New to tapik? Start with Getting Started for a step-by-step tutorial before diving into the full plugin reference below. JDK compatible with the repository defaults (javaTargetVersion=21, toolchain javaToolchainVersion=24 in gradle.properties). Gradle 9+ with the Kotlin DSL; configuration cache and task caching are supported out of the box. Kotlin 2.2.20 (supplied via the Gradle toolchain). Optional modules you plan to use, such as dev.akif.tapik:jackson for JSON bodies or Spring starters for generated code. Component Example Dependency Endpoint DSL implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.4\") Codecs implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:codec:0.2.4\") Jackson integration implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.4\") Gradle plugin id(\"dev.akif.tapik.plugin.gradle\") version \"0.2.4\" The version numbers match the repository snapshot (version=0.2.4). Replace them with the release you are consuming. Configure the plugin in a module that produces HTTP endpoints or needs generated sources: plugins { kotlin(\"jvm\") id(\"dev.akif.tapik.plugin.gradle\") version \"0.2.4\" } dependencies { implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.4\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.4\") // for JSON helpers } tapik { endpointPackages( \"com.acme.catalog.endpoints\", \"com.acme.shared.http\" ) springRestClient { /* enables the Spring RestClient generator */ } springWebMvc { /* enables the Spring WebMVC generator */ } markdownDocumentation { /* enables the Markdown documentation generator */ } } Key things to remember: endpointPackages must reference the packages where compiled endpoint properties live. The scanner filters classes using these prefixes. The nested generator blocks are markers; you do not need to configure anything inside them unless future versions expose options. Generated Kotlin sources land under build/generated/sources/tapik/main/kotlin and are added to the main source set automatically. Non-source artefacts (for example, Markdown files) are written under build/generated. Endpoints are compile-time constants built with the DSL in the core module. The DSL collects metadata from property names, documentation strings, and nested builders. package com.acme.catalog.endpoints import dev.akif.tapik.* import dev.akif.tapik.jackson.jsonBody object ProductEndpoints { private val productId = path.uuid(\"productId\") private val locale = query.string(\"locale\").optional(\"en-US\") val getProduct by endpoint( description = \"Fetch product details\", details = \"Returns localized information when the locale query parameter is supplied.\" ) { get(\"products\" / productId + locale) .input(header.uuid(\"X-Request-Id\")) .output(Status.OK) { jsonBody<ProductView>(\"product\") } .output(Status.NOT_FOUND) { jsonBody<ProblemDetails>(\"problem\") } } } Highlights: endpoint { ... } infers the endpoint id from the property name (getProduct). The description and details flow into generated KDoc and Markdown. Path building uses operator overloads: \"products\" / productId. Query parameters append with , headers with +input { ... }, and outputs use output(Status.OK) { ... }. Response variants can be chained; the DSL supports OneOf unions to model branching behaviour. tapik registers an aggregated tapikGenerate task. It depends on classes for the current project and its siblings to ensure bytecode is available. ./gradlew :service:tapikGenerate Execution flow: Compiled classes are scanned for properties that return HttpEndpoint. Metadata describing the endpoints is persisted to build/generated/tapik-endpoints.txt. The selected generators (spring-restclient, spring-webmvc, markdown-docs) run sequentially. Generated sources are attached to the IDE/classpath; you can ./gradlew build without special configuration. You can run ./gradlew :service:classes tapikGenerate during fast feedback loops. Pass -PskipLint if you want to avoid ktlint locally. Kotlin sources live under build/generated/sources/tapik/main/kotlin. Markdown documentation is emitted to build/generated/API.md. Scan report: build/generated/tapik-endpoints.txt contains the raw metadata list. When checking generated Kotlin into source control: Run ./gradlew tapikGenerate after any endpoint changes. Review generated types as you would review hand-written code; they carry KDoc extracted from your endpoints. For reproducibility, make sure the versions of tapik dependencies are pinned via a version catalog or BOM. Symptom Common Cause Fix Missing compiled classes warning classes task did not run before tapikGenerate Run ./gradlew classes tapikGenerate or wire tasks in your CI pipeline No generators execute Generator blocks omitted in the tapik extension Add springRestClient { }, springWebMvc { }, or markdownDocumentation { } Class not found during scan Endpoint package not covered by endpointPackages Ensure fully qualified package prefixes are listed Unexpected HTTP mappings Endpoint path missing leading segment Start URIs with \"segment\" or \"segment\" / ...

Headers are encoded via the Input.encodeInputHeaders helpers from core; responses use the decodeHeadersX utilities to validate and decode header values. Bodies use the codec attached to the Body definition (for example, Jackson-based JSON codecs). Any CodecFailure surfaces as an IllegalStateException in generated code so mismatches fail fast. RestClientInterpreter validates response status codes and media types before the generator attempts to decode bodies, surfacing detailed RestClientResponseException messages when mismatches occur. Create a Spring-managed implementation by delegating to the generated interface: @Component class HttpProductClient( override val restClient: RestClient ) : ProductEndpointsClient RestClientBasedClient provides interpreter automatically, so implementations only supply the RestClient. You may inject a configured RestClient.Builder or reuse the application-wide client. Drive endpoint behaviour through unit tests on the DSL before running code generation. Use Spring’s MockRestServiceServer to verify generated clients: intercept outgoing requests, assert the expected path/headers/body, and feed back fixtures that satisfy your endpoint outputs. If you customise codecs, add integration tests to ensure RestClientInterpreter can successfully decode the wire format. Provide your own RestClient (set timeouts, interceptors, authentication) while reusing generated code. Override functions in the generated interface by writing extension functions or wrapping the generated interface inside a higher-level service. Add new generators for other HTTP client stacks by following the steps in Code Generation Overview; the Spring client serves as a realistic template.","title":"Spring RestClient Clients","component":"tapik","version":"v0.2.4","name":"client","url":"/tapik/v0.2.4/code-generation/client.html","titles":[{"text":"Generated Structure","hash":"_generated_structure","id":1},{"text":"Return Types","hash":"_return_types","id":2},{"text":"Header and Body Handling","hash":"_header_and_body_handling","id":3},{"text":"Instantiating Clients","hash":"_instantiating_clients","id":4},{"text":"Testing Tips","hash":"_testing_tips","id":5},{"text":"Customisation Hooks","hash":"_customisation_hooks","id":6}]},"33":{"id":33,"text":"tapik ships a Markdown generator (markdown-docs) that produces a lightweight API reference from your endpoint definitions.

Implement the generated interfaces to keep routing, validation, and response typing aligned with the DSL. Location: build/generated/sources/tapik/main/kotlin/<package>/<SourceFile>Controller.kt Interface name: <SourceFile>Controller Annotations: Each method is decorated with the appropriate @GetMapping, @PostMapping, …​ annotations derived from the endpoint metadata, including path, consumes, and produces attributes. Parameters: Path variables receive @SpringPathVariable, query parameters use @RequestParam, headers use @RequestHeader, and bodies use @RequestBody. Default values defined in the DSL are carried into the annotation attributes. Return type: Methods return tapik ResponseX or ResponseWithoutBodyX types. When multiple outputs exist, the return type is OneOfK<...> containing those responses. Example excerpt: interface ProductEndpointsController { /** * Fetch product details. */ @GetMapping( path = [\"/products/{productId}\"], produces = [\"application/json\"] ) fun getProduct( @SpringPathVariable(\"productId\") productId: UUID, @RequestParam(name = \"locale\", required = false, defaultValue = \"en-US\") locale: String, @RequestHeader(name = \"X-Request-Id\") xRequestId: UUID ): Response0<ProductView> } Wire an implementation in your Spring application: @Component class ProductHandler : ProductEndpointsController { override fun getProduct( productId: UUID, locale: String, xRequestId: UUID ): Response0<ProductView> { // fetch domain model and map it into the tapik response type val product = service.lookup(productId, locale) return Response0(Status.OK, product) } } The return value captures the HTTP status, headers, and body exactly as you modelled them in the DSL. Use helper builders from dev.akif.tapik (for example, Response0, ResponseWithoutBody1, OneOf2.Option1) to produce the response variant that matches the status you intend to emit. Create a lightweight HTTP adapter that converts the tapik response to a Spring ResponseEntity using the extensions in TapikResponseEntity.kt: @RestController class ProductController( private val handler: ProductHandler ) { @GetMapping(\"/products/{productId}\") fun getProduct( productId: UUID, locale: String, xRequestId: UUID ): ResponseEntity<Any?> = ProductEndpoints.getProduct.toResponseEntity( handler.getProduct(productId, locale, xRequestId) ) } toResponseEntity(Response<*>) handles single-output endpoints. toResponseEntity(OneOf) handles multi-output unions. Status and media-type conversions rely on Status.toHttpStatus() and MediaType.toSpringMediaType() helpers bundled with the generator. toResponseEntity enforces that your implementation returns the declared number of headers and selects the matching output variant for OneOf unions. If a mismatch occurs (for example, returning Option2 while only one output is defined), the helper throws an error pointing at the offending endpoint. Reuse DSL metadata: The generated interface references the HttpEndpoint instances, so you can lean on .outputs or .parameters inside your implementation for additional logic (for example, building links). Combine with Spring validation: Annotate generated parameters with additional validation annotations (e.g., @Valid, @NotBlank) in partial classes or wrapper controllers if you need extra constraints. Return domain models: The response builders accept your domain types. Keep encoding logic inside the DSL via codecs so controller implementations stay small. Unit-test with tapik types: Write tests against the generated interface contracts to verify that every response path returns the appropriate Response* wrapper. Pair with the toResponseEntity helper for end-to-end tests. The generator chooses method-level annotations based on the HTTP verb. For uncommon verbs (such as OPTIONS or TRACE), it emits @RequestMapping(method = [RequestMethod.VERB], path = [...]). If you need additional attributes (for example, security annotations or custom @CrossOrigin settings), declare them in your concrete controller implementation-interfaces are kept lean on purpose.","title":"Spring WebMVC Controllers","component":"tapik","version":"v0.2.4","name":"server","url":"/tapik/v0.2.4/code-generation/server.html","titles":[{"text":"Generated Structure","hash":"_generated_structure","id":1},{"text":"Implementing Controllers","hash":"_implementing_controllers","id":2},{"text":"Rendering Spring Responses","hash":"_rendering_spring_responses","id":3},{"text":"Status and Header Validation","hash":"_status_and_header_validation","id":4},{"text":"Tips for Server Implementations","hash":"_tips_for_server_implementations","id":5},{"text":"Customising Routing","hash":"_customising_routing","id":6}]},"36":{"id":36,"text":"tapik’s primary goal is to keep HTTP contracts type-safe from declaration to runtime. The DSL models every piece of an endpoint-parameters, headers, bodies, and response branches-with immutable, strongly-typed structures. Generators rely on these structures to emit Kotlin that cannot drift from the original definition. Concept Interface Purpose Common Aliases Heterogeneous tuple (product) AllOf Represents all items that must exist together Parameters, Headers, Outputs, HeaderValues, Responses Discriminated union (sum) OneOf Represents one branch chosen at runtime OneOf2, OneOf3, …​ up to OneOf10 AllOf is a family of interfaces (AllOf0 …​ AllOf10) with itemN accessors. Concrete tapik types reuse these through the Tuple facade so you do not manipulate AllOf directly. typealias Headers3<H1, H2, H3> = Tuple3<Header<*>, Header<H1>, Header<H2>, Header<H3>> Because Headers3 implements AllOf4, the compiler knows: headers.item1 is the first Header<*>. headers.item2 is Header<H1>, preserving the codec type. Iteration is still possible via the Listable interface. tapik ships aliases for each arity so you can declare headers, parameters, and responses without manual tuple plumbing: Alias Description Parameters0 …​ Parameters10 Path/query parameter definitions Headers0 …​ Headers10 Request header definitions HeaderValues0 …​ HeaderValues10 Decoded inbound header values Outputs0 …​ Outputs10 Ordered list of (StatusMatcher, Headers, Body) combinations Response0 / ResponseWithoutBody0 families Runtime responses returned by generated code OneOf models exclusive branches. Each arity exposes inline OptionN value classes and a select helper for exhaustive handling. fun interpret(result: OneOf3<Response0<User>, ResponseWithoutBody0, ResponseWithoutBody0>) = result.select( when1 = { response -> \"Found user ${response.body.id}\" }, when2 = { \"User missing\" }, when3 = { \"User deleted\" } ) Generators lean on these unions in two places: Client code returns OneOfK when an endpoint declares multiple outputs, forcing call sites to handle every status path. Server code expects implementers to return the matching OptionN when emitting a non-default response, ensuring real runtime branches align with the DSL. Outputs is an AllOf tuple of Output definitions. At runtime, responses are wrapped in either a concrete ResponseX (single output) or a OneOfK<ResponseX, ...> (multiple outputs). This combination gives tapik strong guarantees: The number and order of outputs in the DSL matches the generated code and Markdown documentation. Header codecs are preserved all the way to runtime decoding (decodeHeadersN). Exhaustive select calls mean adding a new output is a compile-time change for every consumer. flowchart TD DSL[\"HttpEndpoint DSL\"] --> Tuple[\"Tuple / AllOf metadata\"] Tuple --> Outputs[\"Outputs tuple\"] Outputs -->|single| Response[\"ResponseX\"] Outputs -->|multiple| Union[\"OneOfK ResponseX\"] Response --> Client[\"Generated client\"] Union --> Client Response --> Server[\"Generated controller\"] Union --> Server Prefer aliases: use Headers3 instead of wiring Tuple3 manually. The aliases pick correct variance and marker interfaces. Let the DSL infer tuples: input(header.uuid(\"X-Request-Id\")) returns Input<Headers1<UUID>, EmptyBody> automatically-no explicit types required. Use select in clients: exhaustively pattern match OneOf results to enforce business logic for every status. Return the right union option: when implementing generated controllers, wrap alternate responses in OneOfK.OptionN to keep tapik aware of which branch fired. Leverage codecs: bodies and headers carry codecs, so even custom AllOf combinations continue to encode/decode data safely. Understanding AllOf and OneOf is the key to appreciating tapik: the DSL describes APIs once, and the type system guarantees that every generated artifact agrees with the definition. Take a look at the runtime helpers (EncodeHeadersMethods.kt, DecodeHeadersMethods.kt, Responses.kt) if you want to explore further.","title":"Type Safety in tapik","component":"tapik","version":"v0.2.4","name":"type-safety","url":"/tapik/v0.2.4/concepts/type-safety.html","titles":[{"text":"Building Blocks","hash":"_building_blocks","id":1},{"text":"AllOf and Tuple Aliases","hash":"_allof_and_tuple_aliases","id":2},{"text":"OneOf and Conditional Responses","hash":"_oneof_and_conditional_responses","id":3},{"text":"AllOf + OneOf Together","hash":"_allof_oneof_together","id":4},{"text":"Tips for Working with These Types","hash":"_tips_for_working_with_these_types","id":5}]},"37":{"id":37,"text":"tapik uses a multi-module Gradle build with Kotlin DSL, configuration cache, and extensive code generation.

Disable configuration cache while debugging with -Dorg.gradle.configuration-cache=false. Plugin validation runs only when -PrunPluginValidation is set. Kotlin style follows .editorconfig (4-space indent, 120-char lines, LF endings). Avoid wildcard imports unless they simplify tapik package usage. Keep packages under dev.akif.tapik.<module>; respect the flattened directory structure. Document every public API with KDoc, including type parameters, parameters, returns, and throws. Generated sources belong under build/ or generated/; keep them out of VCS unless explicitly required. Use kotlin(\"test\") with JUnit 5 (junit-jupiter-params for parameterized cases). Place unit tests adjacent to the module (src/test/kotlin). For focused runs: ./gradlew :module:test. Integration flows (e.g., Spring-specific) should live in dedicated source sets such as integrationTest. Favour descriptive test names that outline behaviour rather than method names. Update KDoc and run ./gradlew dokkaGenerateHtml before shipping changes. Rebuild the Antora site (npm run docs:preview) locally if you modify AsciiDoc or navigation. Generated documentation must include the footer © {currentYear} Mehmet Akif Tütüncü; the Dokka configuration enforces it - do not strip it. For local previews that include the API reference, run ./gradlew dokkaGenerate then ./docs/scripts/copy-api.sh after the Antora build. Releases use the current version. After a successful GitHub release, CI automatically runs ./gradlew bumpVersion (defaults to a patch bump) and pushes the commit to the target branch so new development starts with a higher version. For local bumps (e.g., pre-release rehearsal), run ./gradlew bumpVersion -PnewVersion=<nextVersion>; omit newVersion to auto-increment the patch. The task rewrites gradle.properties, docs (AsciiDoc/HTML), Gradle scripts, and properties files that mention the previous version while skipping build outputs and .gradle state. The task writes changes to disk; commit them along with any regenerated docs. Docs are published from release tags; they reflect the latest released version, not unreleased changes on main. Published docs are versioned with Antora: each release tag produces a version and the site default tracks the newest tag. Tags before v0.2.1 lack docs/antora.yml, so the Antora playbooks explicitly exclude v0.1.* and v0.2.0. Declare dependencies through the version catalog (gradle/libs.versions.toml). Reuse bundles like libs.bundles.testCommon to keep versions aligned. Avoid hard-coded coordinates in build scripts; prefer catalog aliases. Update or add tests that cover the behaviour you changed. Run ./gradlew ktlintFormat build and ensure both pass. Refresh generated outputs (tapikGenerate, Dokka) if your change affects them. Verify Antora builds locally (npm run docs:preview) when touching documentation. Craft concise, imperative commit messages (e.g., Add Spring WebMVC generator). Open a PR with intent, summary, linked issues, and screenshots/logs for user-visible changes. Request review from the relevant CODEOWNERS.

This guide walks you through the smallest possible tapik project: adding the dependency, configuring the Gradle plugin, declaring an endpoint, and running the generators. You do not need prior knowledge of tapik-follow the numbered steps and you will generate code and documentation within minutes. tapik is split into JVM artifacts so you can pick only what your service requires: Use Case Dependency Define endpoints, parameters, headers, codecs implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.5\") Use ready-made string/byte codecs implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:codec:0.2.5\") Encode/decode JSON with Jackson implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.5\") Generate Spring RestClient clients implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:spring-restclient:0.2.5\") Generate Spring WebMVC controllers implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:spring-webmvc:0.2.5\") Add them to your build.gradle.kts alongside the Kotlin JVM plugin. tapik integrates with Gradle to scan compiled classes and run generators. Enable the plugin and declare the packages that contain your endpoints: plugins { id(\"dev.akif.tapik.plugin.gradle\") version \"0.2.5\" } dependencies { implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.5\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:codec:0.2.5\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.5\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:spring-restclient:0.2.5\") } tapik { endpointPackages(\"com.acme.catalog\") springRestClient { } markdownDocumentation { } } endpointPackages should include every package that holds val properties returning HttpEndpoint. Declaring springRestClient { } or markdownDocumentation { } is enough to opt into the corresponding generator; future options will live inside those blocks. Create a Kotlin file in src/main/kotlin/com/acme/catalog/ProductEndpoints.kt and describe the HTTP contract using the tapik DSL: package com.acme.catalog import dev.akif.tapik.* import dev.akif.tapik.codec.StringCodecs import dev.akif.tapik.jackson.jsonBody object ProductEndpoints { private val productId = path.uuid(\"productId\") val getProduct by endpoint( description = \"Fetch product details\", details = \"Returns localized information when the optional locale query parameter is supplied.\" ) { get(\"products\" / productId + query.string(\"locale\").optional(\"en-US\")) .input(header.uuid(\"X-Request-Id\")) .output(Status.OK) { jsonBody<ProductView>(\"product\") } .output(Status.NOT_FOUND) { jsonBody<ProblemDetails>(\"problem\") } } } The DSL captures everything tapik needs: Path and query parameters (with codecs and defaults). Request headers, bodies, media types. Response variants keyed by status matchers. Run the tapik task after the Kotlin compiler produces bytecode: ./gradlew tapikGenerate Behind the scenes the plugin: Scans compiled classes under the packages you configured.

New to tapik? Start with Getting Started for a step-by-step tutorial before diving into the full plugin reference below. JDK compatible with the repository defaults (javaTargetVersion=21, toolchain javaToolchainVersion=24 in gradle.properties). Gradle 9+ with the Kotlin DSL; configuration cache and task caching are supported out of the box. Kotlin 2.2.20 (supplied via the Gradle toolchain). Optional modules you plan to use, such as dev.akif.tapik:jackson for JSON bodies or Spring starters for generated code. Component Example Dependency Endpoint DSL implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.5\") Codecs implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:codec:0.2.5\") Jackson integration implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.5\") Gradle plugin id(\"dev.akif.tapik.plugin.gradle\") version \"0.2.5\" The version numbers match the repository snapshot (version=0.2.5). Replace them with the release you are consuming. Configure the plugin in a module that produces HTTP endpoints or needs generated sources: plugins { kotlin(\"jvm\") id(\"dev.akif.tapik.plugin.gradle\") version \"0.2.5\" } dependencies { implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.5\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.5\") // for JSON helpers } tapik { endpointPackages( \"com.acme.catalog.endpoints\", \"com.acme.shared.http\" ) springRestClient { /* enables the Spring RestClient generator */ } springWebMvc { /* enables the Spring WebMVC generator */ } markdownDocumentation { /* enables the Markdown documentation generator */ } } Key things to remember: endpointPackages must reference the packages where compiled endpoint properties live. The scanner filters classes using these prefixes. The nested generator blocks are markers; you do not need to configure anything inside them unless future versions expose options. Generated Kotlin sources land under build/generated/sources/tapik/main/kotlin and are added to the main source set automatically. Non-source artefacts (for example, Markdown files) are written under build/generated. Endpoints are compile-time constants built with the DSL in the core module. The DSL collects metadata from property names, documentation strings, and nested builders. package com.acme.catalog.endpoints import dev.akif.tapik.* import dev.akif.tapik.jackson.jsonBody object ProductEndpoints { private val productId = path.uuid(\"productId\") private val locale = query.string(\"locale\").optional(\"en-US\") val getProduct by endpoint( description = \"Fetch product details\", details = \"Returns localized information when the locale query parameter is supplied.\" ) { get(\"products\" / productId + locale) .input(header.uuid(\"X-Request-Id\")) .output(Status.OK) { jsonBody<ProductView>(\"product\") } .output(Status.NOT_FOUND) { jsonBody<ProblemDetails>(\"problem\") } } } Highlights: endpoint { ... } infers the endpoint id from the property name (getProduct). The description and details flow into generated KDoc and Markdown. Path building uses operator overloads: \"products\" / productId. Query parameters append with , headers with +input { ... }, and outputs use output(Status.OK) { ... }. Response variants can be chained; the DSL supports OneOf unions to model branching behaviour. tapik registers an aggregated tapikGenerate task. It depends on classes for the current project and its siblings to ensure bytecode is available. ./gradlew :service:tapikGenerate Execution flow: Compiled classes are scanned for properties that return HttpEndpoint. Metadata describing the endpoints is persisted to build/generated/tapik-endpoints.txt. The selected generators (spring-restclient, spring-webmvc, markdown-docs) run sequentially. Generated sources are attached to the IDE/classpath; you can ./gradlew build without special configuration. You can run ./gradlew :service:classes tapikGenerate during fast feedback loops. Pass -PskipLint if you want to avoid ktlint locally. Kotlin sources live under build/generated/sources/tapik/main/kotlin. Markdown documentation is emitted to build/generated/API.md. Scan report: build/generated/tapik-endpoints.txt contains the raw metadata list. When checking generated Kotlin into source control: Run ./gradlew tapikGenerate after any endpoint changes. Review generated types as you would review hand-written code; they carry KDoc extracted from your endpoints. For reproducibility, make sure the versions of tapik dependencies are pinned via a version catalog or BOM. Symptom Common Cause Fix Missing compiled classes warning classes task did not run before tapikGenerate Run ./gradlew classes tapikGenerate or wire tasks in your CI pipeline No generators execute Generator blocks omitted in the tapik extension Add springRestClient { }, springWebMvc { }, or markdownDocumentation { } Class not found during scan Endpoint package not covered by endpointPackages Ensure fully qualified package prefixes are listed Unexpected HTTP mappings Endpoint path missing leading segment Start URIs with \"segment\" or \"segment\" / ...

Headers are encoded via the Input.encodeInputHeaders helpers from core; responses use the decodeHeadersX utilities to validate and decode header values. Bodies use the codec attached to the Body definition (for example, Jackson-based JSON codecs). Any CodecFailure surfaces as an IllegalStateException in generated code so mismatches fail fast. RestClientInterpreter validates response status codes and media types before the generator attempts to decode bodies, surfacing detailed RestClientResponseException messages when mismatches occur. Create a Spring-managed implementation by delegating to the generated interface: @Component class HttpProductClient( override val restClient: RestClient ) : ProductEndpointsClient RestClientBasedClient provides interpreter automatically, so implementations only supply the RestClient. You may inject a configured RestClient.Builder or reuse the application-wide client. Drive endpoint behaviour through unit tests on the DSL before running code generation. Use Spring’s MockRestServiceServer to verify generated clients: intercept outgoing requests, assert the expected path/headers/body, and feed back fixtures that satisfy your endpoint outputs. If you customise codecs, add integration tests to ensure RestClientInterpreter can successfully decode the wire format. Provide your own RestClient (set timeouts, interceptors, authentication) while reusing generated code. Override functions in the generated interface by writing extension functions or wrapping the generated interface inside a higher-level service. Add new generators for other HTTP client stacks by following the steps in Code Generation Overview; the Spring client serves as a realistic template.","title":"Spring RestClient Clients","component":"tapik","version":"v0.2.5","name":"client","url":"/tapik/v0.2.5/code-generation/client.html","titles":[{"text":"Generated Structure","hash":"_generated_structure","id":1},{"text":"Return Types","hash":"_return_types","id":2},{"text":"Header and Body Handling","hash":"_header_and_body_handling","id":3},{"text":"Instantiating Clients","hash":"_instantiating_clients","id":4},{"text":"Testing Tips","hash":"_testing_tips","id":5},{"text":"Customisation Hooks","hash":"_customisation_hooks","id":6}]},"42":{"id":42,"text":"tapik ships a Markdown generator (markdown-docs) that produces a lightweight API reference from your endpoint definitions.

Example excerpt: interface ProductEndpointsController { /** * Fetch product details. */ @GetMapping( path = [\"/products/{productId}\"], produces = [\"application/json\"] ) fun getProduct( @SpringPathVariable(\"productId\") productId: UUID, @RequestParam(name = \"locale\", required = false, defaultValue = \"en-US\") locale: String, @RequestHeader(name = \"X-Request-Id\") xRequestId: UUID ): Response0<ProductView> } Wire an implementation in your Spring application: @Component class ProductHandler : ProductEndpointsController { override fun getProduct( productId: UUID, locale: String, xRequestId: UUID ): Response0<ProductView> { // fetch domain model and map it into the tapik response type val product = service.lookup(productId, locale) return Response0(Status.OK, product) } } The return value captures the HTTP status, headers, and body exactly as you modelled them in the DSL. Use helper builders from dev.akif.tapik (for example, Response0, ResponseWithoutBody1, OneOf2.Option1) to produce the response variant that matches the status you intend to emit. Create a lightweight HTTP adapter that converts the tapik response to a Spring ResponseEntity using the extensions in TapikResponseEntity.kt: @RestController class ProductController( private val handler: ProductHandler ) { @GetMapping(\"/products/{productId}\") fun getProduct( productId: UUID, locale: String, xRequestId: UUID ): ResponseEntity<Any?> = ProductEndpoints.getProduct.toResponseEntity( handler.getProduct(productId, locale, xRequestId) ) } toResponseEntity(Response<*>) handles single-output endpoints. toResponseEntity(OneOf) handles multi-output unions. Status and media-type conversions rely on Status.toHttpStatus() and MediaType.toSpringMediaType() helpers bundled with the generator. toResponseEntity enforces that your implementation returns the declared number of headers and selects the matching output variant for OneOf unions. If a mismatch occurs (for example, returning Option2 while only one output is defined), the helper throws an error pointing at the offending endpoint. Reuse DSL metadata: The generated interface references the HttpEndpoint instances, so you can lean on .outputs or .parameters inside your implementation for additional logic (for example, building links). Combine with Spring validation: Annotate generated parameters with additional validation annotations (e.g., @Valid, @NotBlank) in partial classes or wrapper controllers if you need extra constraints. Return domain models: The response builders accept your domain types. Keep encoding logic inside the DSL via codecs so controller implementations stay small. Unit-test with tapik types: Write tests against the generated interface contracts to verify that every response path returns the appropriate Response* wrapper. Pair with the toResponseEntity helper for end-to-end tests. The generator chooses method-level annotations based on the HTTP verb. For uncommon verbs (such as OPTIONS or TRACE), it emits @RequestMapping(method = [RequestMethod.VERB], path = [...]). If you need additional attributes (for example, security annotations or custom @CrossOrigin settings), declare them in your concrete controller implementation-interfaces are kept lean on purpose.","title":"Spring WebMVC Controllers","component":"tapik","version":"v0.2.5","name":"server","url":"/tapik/v0.2.5/code-generation/server.html","titles":[{"text":"Generated Structure","hash":"_generated_structure","id":1},{"text":"Implementing Controllers","hash":"_implementing_controllers","id":2},{"text":"Rendering Spring Responses","hash":"_rendering_spring_responses","id":3},{"text":"Status and Header Validation","hash":"_status_and_header_validation","id":4},{"text":"Tips for Server Implementations","hash":"_tips_for_server_implementations","id":5},{"text":"Customising Routing","hash":"_customising_routing","id":6}]},"45":{"id":45,"text":"tapik’s primary goal is to keep HTTP contracts type-safe from declaration to runtime. The DSL models every piece of an endpoint-parameters, headers, bodies, and response branches-with immutable, strongly-typed structures. Generators rely on these structures to emit Kotlin that cannot drift from the original definition. Concept Interface Purpose Common Aliases Heterogeneous tuple (product) AllOf Represents all items that must exist together Parameters, Headers, Outputs, HeaderValues, Responses Discriminated union (sum) OneOf Represents one branch chosen at runtime OneOf2, OneOf3, …​ up to OneOf10 AllOf is a family of interfaces (AllOf0 …​ AllOf10) with itemN accessors. Concrete tapik types reuse these through the Tuple facade so you do not manipulate AllOf directly. typealias Headers3<H1, H2, H3> = Tuple3<Header<*>, Header<H1>, Header<H2>, Header<H3>> Because Headers3 implements AllOf4, the compiler knows: headers.item1 is the first Header<*>. headers.item2 is Header<H1>, preserving the codec type. Iteration is still possible via the Listable interface. tapik ships aliases for each arity so you can declare headers, parameters, and responses without manual tuple plumbing: Alias Description Parameters0 …​ Parameters10 Path/query parameter definitions Headers0 …​ Headers10 Request header definitions HeaderValues0 …​ HeaderValues10 Decoded inbound header values Outputs0 …​ Outputs10 Ordered list of (StatusMatcher, Headers, Body) combinations Response0 / ResponseWithoutBody0 families Runtime responses returned by generated code OneOf models exclusive branches. Each arity exposes inline OptionN value classes and a select helper for exhaustive handling. fun interpret(result: OneOf3<Response0<User>, ResponseWithoutBody0, ResponseWithoutBody0>) = result.select( when1 = { response -> \"Found user ${response.body.id}\" }, when2 = { \"User missing\" }, when3 = { \"User deleted\" } ) Generators lean on these unions in two places: Client code returns OneOfK when an endpoint declares multiple outputs, forcing call sites to handle every status path. Server code expects implementers to return the matching OptionN when emitting a non-default response, ensuring real runtime branches align with the DSL. Outputs is an AllOf tuple of Output definitions. At runtime, responses are wrapped in either a concrete ResponseX (single output) or a OneOfK<ResponseX, ...> (multiple outputs). This combination gives tapik strong guarantees: The number and order of outputs in the DSL matches the generated code and Markdown documentation. Header codecs are preserved all the way to runtime decoding (decodeHeadersN). Exhaustive select calls mean adding a new output is a compile-time change for every consumer. flowchart TD DSL[\"HttpEndpoint DSL\"] --> Tuple[\"Tuple / AllOf metadata\"] Tuple --> Outputs[\"Outputs tuple\"] Outputs -->|single| Response[\"ResponseX\"] Outputs -->|multiple| Union[\"OneOfK ResponseX\"] Response --> Client[\"Generated client\"] Union --> Client Response --> Server[\"Generated controller\"] Union --> Server Prefer aliases: use Headers3 instead of wiring Tuple3 manually. The aliases pick correct variance and marker interfaces. Let the DSL infer tuples: input(header.uuid(\"X-Request-Id\")) returns Input<Headers1<UUID>, EmptyBody> automatically-no explicit types required. Use select in clients: exhaustively pattern match OneOf results to enforce business logic for every status. Return the right union option: when implementing generated controllers, wrap alternate responses in OneOfK.OptionN to keep tapik aware of which branch fired. Leverage codecs: bodies and headers carry codecs, so even custom AllOf combinations continue to encode/decode data safely. Understanding AllOf and OneOf is the key to appreciating tapik: the DSL describes APIs once, and the type system guarantees that every generated artifact agrees with the definition. Take a look at the runtime helpers (EncodeHeadersMethods.kt, DecodeHeadersMethods.kt, Responses.kt) if you want to explore further.","title":"Type Safety in tapik","component":"tapik","version":"v0.2.5","name":"type-safety","url":"/tapik/v0.2.5/concepts/type-safety.html","titles":[{"text":"Building Blocks","hash":"_building_blocks","id":1},{"text":"AllOf and Tuple Aliases","hash":"_allof_and_tuple_aliases","id":2},{"text":"OneOf and Conditional Responses","hash":"_oneof_and_conditional_responses","id":3},{"text":"AllOf + OneOf Together","hash":"_allof_oneof_together","id":4},{"text":"Tips for Working with These Types","hash":"_tips_for_working_with_these_types","id":5}]},"46":{"id":46,"text":"tapik uses a multi-module Gradle build with Kotlin DSL, configuration cache, and extensive code generation.

Disable configuration cache while debugging with -Dorg.gradle.configuration-cache=false. Plugin validation runs only when -PrunPluginValidation is set. Kotlin style follows .editorconfig (4-space indent, 120-char lines, LF endings). Avoid wildcard imports unless they simplify tapik package usage. Keep packages under dev.akif.tapik.<module>; respect the flattened directory structure. Document every public API with KDoc, including type parameters, parameters, returns, and throws. Generated sources belong under build/ or generated/; keep them out of VCS unless explicitly required. Use kotlin(\"test\") with JUnit 5 (junit-jupiter-params for parameterized cases). Place unit tests adjacent to the module (src/test/kotlin). For focused runs: ./gradlew :module:test. Integration flows (e.g., Spring-specific) should live in dedicated source sets such as integrationTest. Favour descriptive test names that outline behaviour rather than method names. Update KDoc and run ./gradlew dokkaGenerateHtml before shipping changes. Rebuild the Antora site (npm run docs:preview) locally if you modify AsciiDoc or navigation. Generated documentation must include the footer © {currentYear} Mehmet Akif Tütüncü; the Dokka configuration enforces it - do not strip it. For local previews that include the API reference, run ./gradlew dokkaGenerate then ./docs/scripts/copy-api.sh after the Antora build. Releases use the current version. After a successful GitHub release, CI automatically runs ./gradlew bumpVersion (defaults to a patch bump) and pushes the commit to the target branch so new development starts with a higher version. For local bumps (e.g., pre-release rehearsal), run ./gradlew bumpVersion -PnewVersion=<nextVersion>; omit newVersion to auto-increment the patch. The task rewrites gradle.properties, docs (AsciiDoc/HTML), Gradle scripts, and properties files that mention the previous version while skipping build outputs and .gradle state. The task writes changes to disk; commit them along with any regenerated docs. Docs are published from release tags; they reflect the latest released version, not unreleased changes on main. Published docs are versioned with Antora: each release tag produces a version and the site default tracks the newest tag. Tags before v0.2.1 lack docs/antora.yml, so the Antora playbooks explicitly exclude v0.1.* and v0.2.0. Declare dependencies through the version catalog (gradle/libs.versions.toml). Reuse bundles like libs.bundles.testCommon to keep versions aligned. Avoid hard-coded coordinates in build scripts; prefer catalog aliases. Update or add tests that cover the behaviour you changed. Run ./gradlew ktlintFormat build and ensure both pass. Refresh generated outputs (tapikGenerate, Dokka) if your change affects them. Verify Antora builds locally (npm run docs:preview) when touching documentation. Craft concise, imperative commit messages (e.g., Add Spring WebMVC generator). Open a PR with intent, summary, linked issues, and screenshots/logs for user-visible changes. Request review from the relevant CODEOWNERS.

This guide walks you through the smallest possible tapik project: adding the dependency, configuring the Gradle plugin, declaring an endpoint, and running the generators. You do not need prior knowledge of tapik-follow the numbered steps and you will generate code and documentation within minutes. tapik is split into JVM artifacts so you can pick only what your service requires: Use Case Dependency Define endpoints, parameters, headers, codecs implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.6\") Use ready-made string/byte codecs implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:codec:0.2.6\") Encode/decode JSON with Jackson implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.6\") Generate Spring RestClient clients implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:spring-restclient:0.2.6\") Generate Spring WebMVC controllers implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:spring-webmvc:0.2.6\") Add them to your build.gradle.kts alongside the Kotlin JVM plugin. tapik integrates with Gradle to scan compiled classes and run generators. Enable the plugin and declare the packages that contain your endpoints: plugins { id(\"dev.akif.tapik.plugin.gradle\") version \"0.2.6\" } dependencies { implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.6\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:codec:0.2.6\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.6\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:spring-restclient:0.2.6\") } tapik { endpointPackages(\"com.acme.catalog\") springRestClient { } markdownDocumentation { } } endpointPackages should include every package that holds val properties returning HttpEndpoint. Declaring springRestClient { } or markdownDocumentation { } is enough to opt into the corresponding generator; future options will live inside those blocks. Create a Kotlin file in src/main/kotlin/com/acme/catalog/ProductEndpoints.kt and describe the HTTP contract using the tapik DSL: package com.acme.catalog import dev.akif.tapik.* import dev.akif.tapik.codec.StringCodecs import dev.akif.tapik.jackson.jsonBody object ProductEndpoints { private val productId = path.uuid(\"productId\") val getProduct by endpoint( description = \"Fetch product details\", details = \"Returns localized information when the optional locale query parameter is supplied.\" ) { get(\"products\" / productId + query.string(\"locale\").optional(\"en-US\")) .input(header.uuid(\"X-Request-Id\")) .output(Status.OK) { jsonBody<ProductView>(\"product\") } .output(Status.NOT_FOUND) { jsonBody<ProblemDetails>(\"problem\") } } } The DSL captures everything tapik needs: Path and query parameters (with codecs and defaults). Request headers, bodies, media types. Response variants keyed by status matchers. Run the tapik task after the Kotlin compiler produces bytecode: ./gradlew tapikGenerate Behind the scenes the plugin: Scans compiled classes under the packages you configured.

New to tapik? Start with Getting Started for a step-by-step tutorial before diving into the full plugin reference below. JDK compatible with the repository defaults (javaTargetVersion=21, toolchain javaToolchainVersion=24 in gradle.properties). Gradle 9+ with the Kotlin DSL; configuration cache and task caching are supported out of the box. Kotlin 2.2.20 (supplied via the Gradle toolchain). Optional modules you plan to use, such as dev.akif.tapik:jackson for JSON bodies or Spring starters for generated code. Component Example Dependency Endpoint DSL implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.6\") Codecs implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:codec:0.2.6\") Jackson integration implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.6\") Gradle plugin id(\"dev.akif.tapik.plugin.gradle\") version \"0.2.6\" The version numbers match the repository snapshot (version=0.2.6). Replace them with the release you are consuming. Configure the plugin in a module that produces HTTP endpoints or needs generated sources: plugins { kotlin(\"jvm\") id(\"dev.akif.tapik.plugin.gradle\") version \"0.2.6\" } dependencies { implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:core:0.2.6\") implementation(\"dev.akif.tapik:jackson:0.2.6\") // for JSON helpers } tapik { endpointPackages( \"com.acme.catalog.endpoints\", \"com.acme.shared.http\" ) springRestClient { /* enables the Spring RestClient generator */ } springWebMvc { /* enables the Spring WebMVC generator */ } markdownDocumentation { /* enables the Markdown documentation generator */ } } Key things to remember: endpointPackages must reference the packages where compiled endpoint properties live. The scanner filters classes using these prefixes. The nested generator blocks are markers; you do not need to configure anything inside them unless future versions expose options. Generated Kotlin sources land under build/generated/sources/tapik/main/kotlin and are added to the main source set automatically. Non-source artefacts (for example, Markdown files) are written under build/generated. Endpoints are compile-time constants built with the DSL in the core module. The DSL collects metadata from property names, documentation strings, and nested builders. package com.acme.catalog.endpoints import dev.akif.tapik.* import dev.akif.tapik.jackson.jsonBody object ProductEndpoints { private val productId = path.uuid(\"productId\") private val locale = query.string(\"locale\").optional(\"en-US\") val getProduct by endpoint( description = \"Fetch product details\", details = \"Returns localized information when the locale query parameter is supplied.\" ) { get(\"products\" / productId + locale) .input(header.uuid(\"X-Request-Id\")) .output(Status.OK) { jsonBody<ProductView>(\"product\") } .output(Status.NOT_FOUND) { jsonBody<ProblemDetails>(\"problem\") } } } Highlights: endpoint { ... } infers the endpoint id from the property name (getProduct). The description and details flow into generated KDoc and Markdown. Path building uses operator overloads: \"products\" / productId. Query parameters append with , headers with +input { ... }, and outputs use output(Status.OK) { ... }. Response variants can be chained; the DSL supports OneOf unions to model branching behaviour. tapik registers an aggregated tapikGenerate task. It depends on classes for the current project and its siblings to ensure bytecode is available. ./gradlew :service:tapikGenerate Execution flow: Compiled classes are scanned for properties that return HttpEndpoint. Metadata describing the endpoints is persisted to build/generated/tapik-endpoints.txt. The selected generators (spring-restclient, spring-webmvc, markdown-docs) run sequentially. Generated sources are attached to the IDE/classpath; you can ./gradlew build without special configuration. You can run ./gradlew :service:classes tapikGenerate during fast feedback loops. Pass -PskipLint if you want to avoid ktlint locally. Kotlin sources live under build/generated/sources/tapik/main/kotlin. Markdown documentation is emitted to build/generated/API.md. Scan report: build/generated/tapik-endpoints.txt contains the raw metadata list. When checking generated Kotlin into source control: Run ./gradlew tapikGenerate after any endpoint changes. Review generated types as you would review hand-written code; they carry KDoc extracted from your endpoints. For reproducibility, make sure the versions of tapik dependencies are pinned via a version catalog or BOM. Symptom Common Cause Fix Missing compiled classes warning classes task did not run before tapikGenerate Run ./gradlew classes tapikGenerate or wire tasks in your CI pipeline No generators execute Generator blocks omitted in the tapik extension Add springRestClient { }, springWebMvc { }, or markdownDocumentation { } Class not found during scan Endpoint package not covered by endpointPackages Ensure fully qualified package prefixes are listed Unexpected HTTP mappings Endpoint path missing leading segment Start URIs with \"segment\" or \"segment\" / ...

Headers are encoded via the Input.encodeInputHeaders helpers from core; responses use the decodeHeadersX utilities to validate and decode header values. Bodies use the codec attached to the Body definition (for example, Jackson-based JSON codecs). Any CodecFailure surfaces as an IllegalStateException in generated code so mismatches fail fast. RestClientInterpreter validates response status codes and media types before the generator attempts to decode bodies, surfacing detailed RestClientResponseException messages when mismatches occur. Create a Spring-managed implementation by delegating to the generated interface: @Component class HttpProductClient( override val restClient: RestClient ) : ProductEndpointsClient RestClientBasedClient provides interpreter automatically, so implementations only supply the RestClient. You may inject a configured RestClient.Builder or reuse the application-wide client. Drive endpoint behaviour through unit tests on the DSL before running code generation. Use Spring’s MockRestServiceServer to verify generated clients: intercept outgoing requests, assert the expected path/headers/body, and feed back fixtures that satisfy your endpoint outputs. If you customise codecs, add integration tests to ensure RestClientInterpreter can successfully decode the wire format. Provide your own RestClient (set timeouts, interceptors, authentication) while reusing generated code. Override functions in the generated interface by writing extension functions or wrapping the generated interface inside a higher-level service. Add new generators for other HTTP client stacks by following the steps in Code Generation Overview; the Spring client serves as a realistic template.","title":"Spring RestClient Clients","component":"tapik","version":"v0.2.6","name":"client","url":"/tapik/code-generation/client.html","titles":[{"text":"Generated Structure","hash":"_generated_structure","id":1},{"text":"Return Types","hash":"_return_types","id":2},{"text":"Header and Body Handling","hash":"_header_and_body_handling","id":3},{"text":"Instantiating Clients","hash":"_instantiating_clients","id":4},{"text":"Testing Tips","hash":"_testing_tips","id":5},{"text":"Customisation Hooks","hash":"_customisation_hooks","id":6}]},"51":{"id":51,"text":"tapik ships a Markdown generator (markdown-docs) that produces a lightweight API reference from your endpoint definitions.

Users enable it via tapik { customGenerator { } } or by manually populating the enabledGeneratorIds list. Use the supplied TapikGeneratorContext to discover output directories and log messages. Custom generators can co-exist with the provided ones and share the endpoint metadata that tapik already extracts. Keep your generator pure and deterministic-Gradle caches tapikGenerate when outputs do not change.

Implement the generated interfaces to keep routing, validation, and response typing aligned with the DSL. Location: build/generated/sources/tapik/main/kotlin/<package>/<SourceFile>Controller.kt Interface name: <SourceFile>Controller Annotations: Each method is decorated with the appropriate @GetMapping, @PostMapping, …​ annotations derived from the endpoint metadata, including path, consumes, and produces attributes. Parameters: Path variables receive @SpringPathVariable, query parameters use @RequestParam, headers use @RequestHeader, and bodies use @RequestBody. Default values defined in the DSL are carried into the annotation attributes. Return type: Methods return tapik ResponseX or ResponseWithoutBodyX types. When multiple outputs exist, the return type is OneOfK<...> containing those responses. Example excerpt: interface ProductEndpointsController { /** * Fetch product details. */ @GetMapping( path = [\"/products/{productId}\"], produces = [\"application/json\"] ) fun getProduct( @SpringPathVariable(\"productId\") productId: UUID, @RequestParam(name = \"locale\", required = false, defaultValue = \"en-US\") locale: String, @RequestHeader(name = \"X-Request-Id\") xRequestId: UUID ): Response0<ProductView> } Wire an implementation in your Spring application: @Component class ProductHandler : ProductEndpointsController { override fun getProduct( productId: UUID, locale: String, xRequestId: UUID ): Response0<ProductView> { // fetch domain model and map it into the tapik response type val product = service.lookup(productId, locale) return Response0(Status.OK, product) } } The return value captures the HTTP status, headers, and body exactly as you modelled them in the DSL. Use helper builders from dev.akif.tapik (for example, Response0, ResponseWithoutBody1, OneOf2.Option1) to produce the response variant that matches the status you intend to emit. Create a lightweight HTTP adapter that converts the tapik response to a Spring ResponseEntity using the extensions in TapikResponseEntity.kt: @RestController class ProductController( private val handler: ProductHandler ) { @GetMapping(\"/products/{productId}\") fun getProduct( productId: UUID, locale: String, xRequestId: UUID ): ResponseEntity<Any?> = ProductEndpoints.getProduct.toResponseEntity( handler.getProduct(productId, locale, xRequestId) ) } toResponseEntity(Response<*>) handles single-output endpoints. toResponseEntity(OneOf) handles multi-output unions. Status and media-type conversions rely on Status.toHttpStatus() and MediaType.toSpringMediaType() helpers bundled with the generator. toResponseEntity enforces that your implementation returns the declared number of headers and selects the matching output variant for OneOf unions. If a mismatch occurs (for example, returning Option2 while only one output is defined), the helper throws an error pointing at the offending endpoint. Reuse DSL metadata: The generated interface references the HttpEndpoint instances, so you can lean on .outputs or .parameters inside your implementation for additional logic (for example, building links). Combine with Spring validation: Annotate generated parameters with additional validation annotations (e.g., @Valid, @NotBlank) in partial classes or wrapper controllers if you need extra constraints. Return domain models: The response builders accept your domain types. Keep encoding logic inside the DSL via codecs so controller implementations stay small. Unit-test with tapik types: Write tests against the generated interface contracts to verify that every response path returns the appropriate Response* wrapper. Pair with the toResponseEntity helper for end-to-end tests. The generator chooses method-level annotations based on the HTTP verb. For uncommon verbs (such as OPTIONS or TRACE), it emits @RequestMapping(method = [RequestMethod.VERB], path = [...]). If you need additional attributes (for example, security annotations or custom @CrossOrigin settings), declare them in your concrete controller implementation-interfaces are kept lean on purpose.","title":"Spring WebMVC Controllers","component":"tapik","version":"v0.2.6","name":"server","url":"/tapik/code-generation/server.html","titles":[{"text":"Generated Structure","hash":"_generated_structure","id":1},{"text":"Implementing Controllers","hash":"_implementing_controllers","id":2},{"text":"Rendering Spring Responses","hash":"_rendering_spring_responses","id":3},{"text":"Status and Header Validation","hash":"_status_and_header_validation","id":4},{"text":"Tips for Server Implementations","hash":"_tips_for_server_implementations","id":5},{"text":"Customising Routing","hash":"_customising_routing","id":6}]},"54":{"id":54,"text":"tapik’s primary goal is to keep HTTP contracts type-safe from declaration to runtime. The DSL models every piece of an endpoint-parameters, headers, bodies, and response branches-with immutable, strongly-typed structures. Generators rely on these structures to emit Kotlin that cannot drift from the original definition. Concept Interface Purpose Common Aliases Heterogeneous tuple (product) AllOf Represents all items that must exist together Parameters, Headers, Outputs, HeaderValues, Responses Discriminated union (sum) OneOf Represents one branch chosen at runtime OneOf2, OneOf3, …​ up to OneOf10 AllOf is a family of interfaces (AllOf0 …​ AllOf10) with itemN accessors. Concrete tapik types reuse these through the Tuple facade so you do not manipulate AllOf directly. typealias Headers3<H1, H2, H3> = Tuple3<Header<*>, Header<H1>, Header<H2>, Header<H3>> Because Headers3 implements AllOf4, the compiler knows: headers.item1 is the first Header<*>. headers.item2 is Header<H1>, preserving the codec type. Iteration is still possible via the Listable interface. tapik ships aliases for each arity so you can declare headers, parameters, and responses without manual tuple plumbing: Alias Description Parameters0 …​ Parameters10 Path/query parameter definitions Headers0 …​ Headers10 Request header definitions HeaderValues0 …​ HeaderValues10 Decoded inbound header values Outputs0 …​ Outputs10 Ordered list of (StatusMatcher, Headers, Body) combinations Response0 / ResponseWithoutBody0 families Runtime responses returned by generated code OneOf models exclusive branches. Each arity exposes inline OptionN value classes and a select helper for exhaustive handling. fun interpret(result: OneOf3<Response0<User>, ResponseWithoutBody0, ResponseWithoutBody0>) = result.select( when1 = { response -> \"Found user ${response.body.id}\" }, when2 = { \"User missing\" }, when3 = { \"User deleted\" } ) Generators lean on these unions in two places: Client code returns OneOfK when an endpoint declares multiple outputs, forcing call sites to handle every status path. Server code expects implementers to return the matching OptionN when emitting a non-default response, ensuring real runtime branches align with the DSL. Outputs is an AllOf tuple of Output definitions. At runtime, responses are wrapped in either a concrete ResponseX (single output) or a OneOfK<ResponseX, ...> (multiple outputs). This combination gives tapik strong guarantees: The number and order of outputs in the DSL matches the generated code and Markdown documentation. Header codecs are preserved all the way to runtime decoding (decodeHeadersN). Exhaustive select calls mean adding a new output is a compile-time change for every consumer. flowchart TD DSL[\"HttpEndpoint DSL\"] --> Tuple[\"Tuple / AllOf metadata\"] Tuple --> Outputs[\"Outputs tuple\"] Outputs -->|single| Response[\"ResponseX\"] Outputs -->|multiple| Union[\"OneOfK ResponseX\"] Response --> Client[\"Generated client\"] Union --> Client Response --> Server[\"Generated controller\"] Union --> Server Prefer aliases: use Headers3 instead of wiring Tuple3 manually. The aliases pick correct variance and marker interfaces. Let the DSL infer tuples: input(header.uuid(\"X-Request-Id\")) returns Input<Headers1<UUID>, EmptyBody> automatically-no explicit types required. Use select in clients: exhaustively pattern match OneOf results to enforce business logic for every status. Return the right union option: when implementing generated controllers, wrap alternate responses in OneOfK.OptionN to keep tapik aware of which branch fired. Leverage codecs: bodies and headers carry codecs, so even custom AllOf combinations continue to encode/decode data safely. Understanding AllOf and OneOf is the key to appreciating tapik: the DSL describes APIs once, and the type system guarantees that every generated artifact agrees with the definition. Take a look at the runtime helpers (EncodeHeadersMethods.kt, DecodeHeadersMethods.kt, Responses.kt) if you want to explore further.","title":"Type Safety in
