= Type Safety in tapik

tapik's primary goal is to keep HTTP contracts type-safe from declaration to runtime. The DSL models every piece of an endpoint-parameters, headers, bodies, and response branches-with immutable, strongly-typed structures. Generators rely on these structures to emit Kotlin that cannot drift from the original definition.

== Building Blocks

|===
| Concept | Interface | Purpose | Common Aliases

| Heterogeneous tuple (product)
| +AllOf+
| Represents *all* items that must exist together
| +Parameters+, +Headers+, +Outputs+, +HeaderValues+, +Responses+

| Discriminated union (sum)
| +OneOf+
| Represents *one* branch chosen at runtime
| +OneOf2+, +OneOf3+, ... up to +OneOf10+
|===

=== AllOf and Tuple Aliases

+AllOf+ is a family of interfaces (+AllOf0+ ... +AllOf10+) with +itemN+ accessors. Concrete tapik types reuse these through the +Tuple+ facade so you do not manipulate +AllOf+ directly.

[source,kotlin]
----
typealias Headers3<H1, H2, H3> =
    Tuple3<Header<*>, Header<H1>, Header<H2>, Header<H3>>
----

Because +Headers3+ implements +AllOf4+, the compiler knows:

* +headers.item1+ is the first +Header<*>+.
* +headers.item2+ is +Header<H1>+, preserving the codec type.
* Iteration is still possible via the +Listable+ interface.

tapik ships aliases for each arity so you can declare headers, parameters, and responses without manual tuple plumbing:

|===
| Alias | Description

| +Parameters0+ ... +Parameters10+
| Path/query parameter definitions

| +Headers0+ ... +Headers10+
| Request header definitions

| +HeaderValues0+ ... +HeaderValues10+
| Decoded inbound header values

| +Outputs0+ ... +Outputs10+
| Ordered list of +(StatusMatcher, Headers, Body)+ combinations

| +Response0+ / +ResponseWithoutBody0+ families
| Runtime responses returned by generated code
|===

=== OneOf and Conditional Responses

+OneOf+ models exclusive branches. Each arity exposes inline +OptionN+ value classes and a +select+ helper for exhaustive handling.

[source,kotlin]
----
fun interpret(result: OneOf3<Response0<User>, ResponseWithoutBody0, ResponseWithoutBody0>) =
    result.select(
        when1 = { response -> "Found user ${response.body.id}" },
        when2 = { "User missing" },
        when3 = { "User deleted" }
    )
----

Generators lean on these unions in two places:

* *Client code* returns +OneOfK+ when an endpoint declares multiple outputs, forcing call sites to handle every status path.
* *Server code* expects implementers to return the matching +OptionN+ when emitting a non-default response, ensuring real runtime branches align with the DSL.

=== AllOf + OneOf Together

+Outputs+ is an +AllOf+ tuple of +Output+ definitions. At runtime, responses are wrapped in either a concrete +ResponseX+ (single output) or a +OneOfK<ResponseX, ...>+ (multiple outputs). This combination gives tapik strong guarantees:

. The number and order of outputs in the DSL matches the generated code and Markdown documentation.
. Header codecs are preserved all the way to runtime decoding (+decodeHeadersN+).
. Exhaustive +select+ calls mean adding a new output is a compile-time change for every consumer.

== Tips for Working with These Types

. *Prefer aliases*: use +Headers3+ instead of wiring +Tuple3+ manually. The aliases pick correct variance and marker interfaces.
. *Let the DSL infer tuples*: +input(header.uuid("X-Request-Id"))+ returns +Input<Headers1<UUID>, EmptyBody>+ automatically-no explicit types required.
. *Use +select+ in clients*: exhaustively pattern match +OneOf+ results to enforce business logic for every status.
. *Return the right union option*: when implementing generated controllers, wrap alternate responses in +OneOfK.OptionN+ to keep tapik aware of which branch fired.
. *Leverage codecs*: bodies and headers carry codecs, so even custom +AllOf+ combinations continue to encode/decode data safely.

Understanding +AllOf+ and +OneOf+ is the key to appreciating tapik: the DSL describes APIs once, and the type system guarantees that every generated artifact agrees with the definition. Take a look at the runtime helpers (+EncodeHeadersMethods.kt+, +DecodeHeadersMethods.kt+, +Responses.kt+) if you want to explore further.
