= tapik

Tapik lets you describe HTTP endpoints once in Kotlin and generate clients, servers, and human-readable documentation from the same source of truth. The library captures full type information, headers, URI parameters, and status-driven flows to keep runtime code and docs in sync.

== Key Capabilities

* Declarative DSL to model HTTP verbs, URI templates, headers, bodies, and status-driven responses.
* Classpath scanning that keeps generated artefacts aligned with compiled endpoint definitions.
* Pluggable generator architecture powered by Java +ServiceLoader+; enable only what you need.
* First-party generators for Spring RestClient clients, Spring WebMVC controllers, and Markdown documentation.
* Kotlin-first ergonomics: strongly typed parameters, Arrow interoperability, and codec abstractions for custom payloads.
